FACEBOOK DELETES MICHIGAN ANTI-LOCKDOWN GROUP WITH 380,000 MEMBERS. 	"Facebook has shuttered a popular group for Michiganders who oppose their governor’s extreme lockdown measures, fueling debate about free speech during the coronavirus crisis.

‘Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine’ had more than 380,000 members, with media reports describing it as one of the largest anti-lockdown groups in the nation. It’s not clear if Facebook has provided an explanation for the group’s removal.

Visiting the page gives the following message: “Sorry, this content isn’t available right now.”

Garrett Soldano of Mattawan, Michigan created Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine in April after becoming disenchanted with Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order – a policy which he initially supported.

The group made headlines around the world after organizing ‘Operation Gridlock’, a protest in which thousands of cars created bumper-to-bumper traffic in the capital, Lansing.

Protesters were encouraged to stay in their automobiles and adhere to social distancing guidelines. However, several hundred demonstrators ended up rallying outside the state house.

Many members of the group used the space to talk about the depression and financial hardships that they were experiencing as a result of the governor’s executive orders, first enacted in March 23, which have forced all ‘non-essential’ businesses and to remain closed. Whitmer unilaterally extended her emergency powers in May, after the legislature voted to let them expire. The governor has used these executive powers as the legal basis for the state’s lockdown.

“They will not silence us,” Soldano said in a video message after the group was deleted.

“This just proves to all of us out there that we were right. That there is a deep agenda going on. They’re trying to keep us quiet… Now we fight back. And we have the numbers.”

For now, the message is unavailable on Facebook. On Wednesday, Soldano began promoting a new page, Stand Up Michigan, which gained thousands of members before also being pulled from the site.

The removal of Soldan’s anti-lockdown group has not gone unnoticed on social media. Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson described the decision to pull the page as a clear example of “censorship.”

Some challenged the notion, apparently arguing that the group’s beliefs were not worthy of being protected. Even Elon Musk, who re-opened his Tesla plant in California in defiance of local officials, weighed in. Last month, Facebook deleted anti-lockdown pages that were organizing demonstrations in California, Nebraska, and New Jersey, claiming that the groups were in violation of those states’ stay-at-home orders.

Meanwhile, the tech giant announced that it would be working with fact-checkers to “stop the spread of misinformation and harmful content about Covid-19.” An update regarding the policy, dated May 12, states that the platform put warning labels on around 50 million “pieces of content related to Covid-19.” "

As thousands of Americans pour onto the now open beaches of America. Most Americans are waking up to the undeniable fact that they were lead astray. Coronavirus numbers were skewed. Authoritarian politicians abused their power. And the united front never materialized. The media’s lock down narrative has gradually become back chatter to a nation burned out on the globalist deception.

Even before this pandemic came along, the suicide rate in the United States was already soaring, and now the number of suicides is spiking like we have never seen before.  Just consider what Dr. Mike deBoisblanc of John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, California says is happening in his area. Needless to say, this is more self-destructive behavior that is just going to fuel even more anxiety, depression and despair.

Yes, this pandemic has been bad.  There have been more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States so far, and about 100,000 Americans have died.

But this isn’t the worst thing that we are going to face.  In fact, it isn’t even close.

So if we can’t handle what is happening right now, how in the world are we going to be able to handle what is coming?

The good news is that this pandemic is causing a lot of people to wake up and reflect on what really matters.

Prior to COVID-19, a lot of Americans were living for their careers.  But this crisis has demonstrated how rapidly those jobs can disappear.  There is absolutely no loyalty in the corporate world today, and most corporations will not hesitate to lay off workers once they start bleeding money.  At this point, more than 38 million Americans have already lost their jobs, and more job losses are coming in the weeks and months ahead.

Other Americans were living for the pleasures of this life before this pandemic came along.  But now bars, clubs and movie theaters all over the country have been shut down, professional sports leagues have been paralyzed, and this virus has even transformed dating into a hazard that many people simply don’t want to deal with.

So many of the things that we once valued so highly have been taken away, and maybe that is precisely what we needed.

And suicide helplines all over America are seeing an enormous increase in the number of people calling in…

Many crisis centers are reporting 30% to 40% increases in the number of people seeking help. The helpline at Provident is experiencing a tenfold increase compared with this time last year, when no national disaster was occurring.

In addition to being isolated in their own homes, Americans have also been bombarded by endless coverage of this pandemic by the mainstream media, and this has definitely helped to fuel a lot of anxiety…

In all, 66% are watching and consuming more news than ever before, which is particularly puzzling considering that 68% also admitted that COVID-19 coverage gives them considerable anxiety. It’s not just anxiety either; 65% said they feel overwhelmed by coronavirus news, 56% just get plain angry, 67% feel burnt out, 59% experience fearfulness, and 50% can’t help but feel hopeless after hearing the nightly news.

And of course Americans are not just watching more news than ever before.  According to Comcast, the average U.S. household has actually been watching 66 hours of TV a week during this pandemic…

New research from telecomms firm Comcast has revealed viewing time has soared as a result, with households watching an extra eight-plus hours of TV each week – equivalent to the time spent on a full days’ work shift.

This means the average household now watches 66 hours of TV a week, up from 57 hours a week in early March.

A majority of teens and young adults say they are praying more or thinking about spiritual issues more than they were prior to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey.

The poll of 800 high school students and 800 post-secondary students found that 67 percent said they’re either praying more often or thinking about spiritual issues more compared to the time before the virus.

There is hope, but it won’t be found on a television screen, at the bottom of a bottle or at the end of a needle.

So please don’t give up.  Despite all of the craziness in our world today, the best chapters of your life can still be ahead of you.

But if you keep feeding your mind endless hours of media “programming” and you keep chasing the things that they tell you to chase, all that is ahead of you is more pain, more anxiety, more depression and more despair."
NY TIMES WORRIES HALF OF AMERICANS WILL REFUSE TO TAKE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE. 	"The New York Times has published an article by popular author Kevin Roose in which he expresses his concern that half of Americans would refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine.

The vaccine, if it ever gets produced since there has never been one for any coronavirus including SARS, is likely to take 12-24 months according to experts.

In his article entitled What if we get a Covid-19 vaccine and half the country refuses to take it?, Roose laments the popularity of an anti-vaxxer video called Plandemic, which despite being censored numerous times by every major social media network has still been seen by millions of people.

Roose says that the urgency with which a vaccine will need to be produced will allow anti-vaxxers to claim it’s unsafe.

“Any promising Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be fast-tracked through the testing and approval process,” he writes. “It may not go through years of clinical trials and careful studies of possible long-term side effects, the way other drugs do. That could create an opening for anti-vaccine activists to claim that it is untested and dangerous, and to spin reasonable concerns about the vaccine into widespread, unfounded fears about its safety.”

The involvement of Bill Gates in the distribution of any vaccine will also fuel a backlash, according to Roose.

“If that’s the case, anti-vaccine activists, who have been crusading against these groups for years, will have plenty of material stockpiled to try to discredit them. They are already taking aim at Mr. Gates with baseless conspiracy theories claiming that he created and is trying to profit from the virus. These theories will be amplified, and the attempts to discredit leading virus research efforts will intensify as the vaccine nears.”

Finally, he asserts that it would be “a good idea” to make the vaccine mandatory if Americans want to fly or send their kids to certain schools, but that this “would play into some of the worst fears of the anti-vaccine movement” and create “a tangle of legal roadblocks and damaging publicity campaigns.”"
CDC adds 6 new possible symptoms of Covid-19. 	When the coronavirus outbreak began, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed cough, shortness of breath and fever as possible symptoms. Now, the organization is adding six new possible symptoms to its list, including headache, chills and loss of taste or smell.
TRUMP: PELOSI IS A ‘SICK WOMAN’ WITH A LOT OF ‘MENTAL PROBLEMS’. 	"President Trump slammed Nancy Pelosi Tuesday, calling her a “sick woman” with a lot of “mental problems” after Pelosi said Trump should fear for his life taking hydroxychloroquine because he is ‘morbidly obese’.  Trump also hit out at a study on hydroxychloroquine, claiming it can have severe side effects leading to death, calling the results a “Trump enemy statement.”

“I’ve worked with doctors and if you look at the one survey – the only bad survey – they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead.” the President asserted.

Trump again claimed that many front line healthcare workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. “A lot of our front line workers take it because it possibly and – I think it does but you know these people are going to have to make up their own mind. Plus, it doesn’t hurt people. It’s been out of the market for 60 or 65 years for malaria, lupus and other things,” he said.

“I think it gives you an additional level of safety, but you can ask many doctors are in favor of it. Many front line workers won’t go there, unless they have the hydroxy.” the President continued.

“And so again this is an individual decision to make, but it’s had a great reputation. And if it was somebody else other than me, people would say gee isn’t that smart,” Trump quipped.

Yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed that Trump must have some financial interest in hydroxychloroquine, a claim that has previously been proven false. “Maybe he has family or friends who own part of the company. It’s not unlike the president. Someone at Mar-A-Lago, calls him on the phone, tells him, ‘Oh, this is a good company,’ and he just talks about it. Maybe he did it to divert attention from all the bad things happening, and maybe he’s just lying.” Schumer told MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

“This president doesn’t tell the truth. He may be taking this, may not,” Schumer also charged, echoing host Joe Scarborough who proclaimed that “the president is not taking it, and yet, and yet, he’s telling Americans that they should take it.”"
TWO SEPARATE REPORTS CONFIRM ‘MOST INTEL AGENCIES’ IN US BELIEVE CORONAVIRUS CAME FROM WUHAN LAB. 	"Two separate reports cited a senior intelligence official as confirming that most of the 17 US intelligence agencies believe that the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan Institute of virology.

The Daily Caller spoke to one senior official, who anonymously related that “the majority view among the US intelligence community agencies is that COVID-19 is natural and accidentally leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan.”

The official told the news site that not all agencies are “fully behind the idea” that the spread was due to an accidental laboratory leak, but “most believe that to be the case.”

The official also stated that the intelligence agencies are unanimously in agreement that the outbreak “was not the result of an intentional act.”

The report dovetails with details contained in a Fox News investigation, which also cited a senior official as saying that most of the intel community is decided on the lab leak theory.

White House reporter John Roberts reported Saturday “there is agreement among most of the 17 Intelligence agencies that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab. The source stressed that the release is believed to be a MISTAKE, and was not intentional.”  The agencies that have yet to commit to the theory as confirmed are awaiting a more solid “smoking gun,” according to the official.

 The findings come after a ‘five eyes’ report was leaked, detailing how the intelligence agencies of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada all believe China engaged in a cover up of the real severity of the outbreak.

The document, obtained by Australia’s Saturday Telegraph newspaper,  finds that China’s secrecy amounted to an “assault on international transparency.”

The confirmation from the senior US official contradicts a report in the New York Times last week that suggested the White House has unduly pressured intelligence agencies to link the Wuhan bio-lab to the coronavirus outbreak.

The story was repeatedly cited by mainstream sources and leftist websites, to suggest that US intelligence agencies have all but dismissed the notion, when that clearly appears to be the opposite of what is happening.

Prominent scientists are on record dating back years, with warnings that Chinese virus research is unsafe, with many saying that the Wuhan institute has to be considered the number one suspect as the origin for the current global pandemic."
UNIVERSITY GIVING CORONAVIRUS AID MONEY TO ILLEGALS. 	"After the recent Department of Education guidelines clarified that federal funds through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act should not be distributed by colleges to illegal immigrants, the University of Washington announced plans to give money to illegal immigrant students through other “non-federal” means.

Students who were ineligible to receive federal grants due to their immigration status were invited by UW to apply for separate funding.

Students were told approval would be automatic if they had already submitted their Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WAFSA). One study estimated the total number of illegal immigrant students in Washington State at 13,000.

WAFSA is a Washington program for illegal immigrants, who are largely ineligible for federal funding. It is unknown how much money will be distributed through the program. UW received $39.7 million in federal CARES Act funding.

“While the U.S. Department of Education does not allow CARES funding to provide grants to undocumented students,” UW said on its website, “the UW will provide grants to undocumented students who meet the same criteria for eligibility and greatest financial need as those students receiving a UW CARES Act Relief grant. These grants are funded by non-federal sources. The grant amounts are $1,200 per student and $1,700 for students with dependents.”

“We are so grateful for your commitment to your degree programs and the empathy and compassion you have demonstrated, even as you face uncertainty about your own futures,” President Ana Mari Cauce wrote in a school email to students eligible for the CARES Act grants. “We are doing everything within our means to support you as you pursue your degrees.”

But not all are on board with giving money to illegal immigrant students. UW student Esther Grang told Campus Reform, “It feels like UW is following the letter of the law, but not the spirit,” adding “I don’t particularly care that the university is sending out checks, but if they could do it for one group of students, why not everyone?”

The move by UW comes as leftist groups have been critical of the Trump administration for issuing guidance saying the funds cannot be distributed to illegal immigrant students.

The aid money for UW illegals is not technically federal funding, but as Heritage Foundation senior adviser for executive branch relations Mike Howell previously told Campus Reform, “it’s all fungible money, so every dollar that goes to an illegal alien is a dollar that a US citizen is not getting.”

When asked to provide details on where the funding came from, UW simply responded, “non-federal sources.” "
NFL ‘PREPARED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS’ IF CALIFORNIA LOCKDOWN EXTENDS INTO SEASON. 	"The NFL has three teams in California, and they’re keeping open the possibility of moving them if California’s lockdown continues into the regular season.

The question of whether the NFL would relocate California teams (specifically Los Angeles teams) was posed to NFL Spokesman Brian McCarthy by Gilbert Manzano of the Southern California News Group. Though McCarthy did not say that the NFL would move the teams, he also declined to rule it out.

“We are preparing to play the 2020 NFL season as scheduled and with increased protocols and safety measures for all players, personnel and attendees,” McCarthy said. “This includes games at SoFi Stadium. We will be prepared to make adjustments as necessary, as we have during this offseason, demonstrating that we can safely and efficiently conduct key activities, such as free agency, the virtual offseason program, and the 2020 NFL Draft."
‘Fewer Covid-19 cases in hotter regions’ . 	"‘Fewer Covid-19 cases in hotter regions’ U Tejonmayam | TNN | Apr 26, 2020, 06:25 IST Researchers at IIT-M found that 90% of the total confirmed cases were recorded in regions with temperatures be... Read More CHENNAI: A team of researchers from IIT Madras has found that there is a lower incidence of Covid-19 in regions recording high temperatures.
The team, which did a statistical analysis of more than 1.07 lakh cases from 85 different locations in the most affected countries, found that 90% of the total confirmed cases were recorded in regions with temperatures between 3°C and 12°C.
On the surge in cases in Chennai, which records a maximum of 36°C, the researchers indicated that people’s adherence to lockdown measures and advice of medical experts also play an important role in bringing down cases.
Professor Sachin S Gunthe from IIT-M’s department of civil engineering said previous studies on other influenza viruses have shown that their survival period on certain surfaces may reduce when exposed to high temperatures or high UV index. “This study for coronavirus, however, is purely based on statistical evidences. There is no physiological evidence as yet to prove this fact. Nevertheless, if what we have seen in the study is true then if people follow the lockdown rules strictly and observe the advice of medical experts, we may come out of this crisis quicker than other nations,” he said.
The IIT-M study, published in Journal of Public Health, showed that an increase in the UV index, which is the strength of sunburn producing ultraviolet radiation, also correlated with a decrease in the number of cases. It led the researchers to suggest that artificial UV radiation could be one of the effective ways to sterilize builtup environments for reducing community spread. Rainfall, humidity and cloud cover have no effect on the virus, according to the statistical analysis.
The researchers took into account previous studies that showed influenza-causing viruses peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside as temperatures get warmer. Since people with Covid-19 mostly exhibit flu-like symptoms, the team expected coronavirus to show similar patterns, which is physiologically to be proven.
The researchers arrived at the results by preparing scatter plots or mathematical diagrams with the number of confirmed cases and the various meteorological parameters. Data on confirmed cases in cities, reported between February 2 and March 7 that contributed to 70% of the total number of cases in countries like China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, USA, Spain and Japan were plotted against weather parameters like maximum, minimum and average temperatures, UV index, precipitation, humidity and cloud cover.
The researchers said their results are preliminary and require a detailed physiological studies involving the confirmed cases.

Colorado governor says he's worried about possible second spike in Covid-19 cases as state set to reopen Monday. 	"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Sunday said he is worried about the potential for a second spike in coronavirus cases as the state begins loosening restrictions this week.
The Democrat announced early last week that the state would move into a “ Safer At Home ” phase on Monday, April 27, in which residents would not be ordered to stay in their home but are encouraged to stay there as much as possible. Polis told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday that the more aggressive, stay-at-home measure “has been effective in leveling and plateauing the curve which is absolutely critical if we’re going to in … any way sustain the social distancing,” while adding, “We don’t even have an end date in sight until there’s a vaccine or cure.”
Asked about a warning from the Colorado School of Public Health about the threat of a second spike in cases, Polis told Tapper, “Yeah, we’re all worried about a potential for a second spike, whether it’s in the Fall, along with flu season in September/October, whether it’s July.”
“It’s why we’ve really been really laser focused as an administration on figuring out how we can endure and sustain,” he added.
The governor, when asked if he would reissue another stay-at-home order if he saw a new surge in Covid-19 cases, told Tapper he would look at data and “adjust in real time” as needed.
“We’ll have to adjust, and we expect that we’ll have to adjust the degree of social distancing in real time, meaning we’re going to look at those early indicators, the mobility data,” he said. “We’re going to look at disease data. We’re going to look at a number of different proxies. And as we need to, adjust it in real time.”
Under the state’s Safer-At-Home phase, retail businesses with curbside delivery can reopen and elective medical procedures can resume. Gyms, spas and night clubs will stay closed, while businesses such as dog grooming, tattoo parlors and personal training can open with strict precaution.
As of Sunday morning, there were more than 939,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 53,000 deaths, with more than 12,900 cases and at least 684 deaths in Colorado alone.
Asked by Tapper if he was worried his decision to reopen the state could cost lives, Polis said, “We have to make the best informed decisions based on data and science with the information we have.”
“What we know is that what matters a lot more than the date that the stay-at-home order ends is what we do going forward,” he said. “And how we have an ongoing, sustainable way, psychologically, economically and from a health perspective, to have the social distancing we need at the workplace.”"
We are genetically stronger to take on Covid-19, says scientist . 	"We are genetically stronger to take on Covid-19, says scientist Sukshma Ramakrishnan | TNN | Apr 27, 2020, 12:48 IST The genetic make-up and food habits of Southeast Asians including Indians have given them a better chance of fighting Covid-19 keeping in view our encouraging response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, says Dr T Mariappan, former scientist and now senior deputy director at Indian Council for Medical Research’s Vector Control Research Centre (VCRC). He said the country will have to prepare for dengue and Covid-19 cases when the monsoon sets in.
“Southeast Asians are well protected hereditarily and have developed strong and powerful genes to fight against vector-borne viral diseases. They are exposed to various blood sucking insects, especially mosquitoes, unlike those in continents like Europe or Americas, which help them develop immunity against several viral diseases,” Dr Mariappan told TOI. He said India had little trouble during the SARS outbreak. According to a newsletter published by National Institute of Communicable Diseases, till April 9, 2003, no SARS cases were reported in India but other countries had a vast number of them by then. The virus causing Covid-19, SARS CoV-2, is from the same family of viruses.
“Food habits play a part in ensuring we are protected from certain diseases. In South India, we keep ‘rasam’ in our diet. Its ingredients like garlic, pepper and bellary, which has anti-oxidants, protect lungs. Notably, the number of deaths compared to number of cases is much less in Tamil Nadu and India,” said Dr Mariappan. He said geographical location plays a role when it comes to number of cases, observing that districts like Nagapattinam and Ramanathapuram, which are close to the shore and have scattered population are likely to have less number of Covid-19 cases. Areas with dense population would have more cases as there is more chance of Covid-19 spreading through contact.
The scientist said in future, there could be a possibility of having to tackle dengue and Covid-19 cases at the same time. “So far, no vaccine has been developed to fight dengue as well. With rains already starting in many parts, dengue cases will come up. The onus is on the individual to practise hygiene and stay safe,” said Dr Mariappan.

NYT STORY THAT CLAIMS US OFFICIALS ‘PRESSURED’ SPIES TO LINK LAB TO CORONAVIRUS IS BASED ON ONE PERSON’S COMMENTS FROM JANUARY. 	"A New York Times story published Thursday claimed that Trump officials have unduly pressured intelligence agencies to link the Wuhan bio-lab to the coronavirus outbreak, yet it simultaneously admits that the president has done no such thing and is based mostly around one comment made by a National Security Council official in January.

The story was cited by mainstream sources and leftist websites ad-nauseam Thursday night, as some kind of proof that the Chinese lab has nothing to do with the virus outbreak.

It was also used to suggest that US intelligence agencies have all but dismissed the notion, when that is simply not the case.

The Times piece cites ‘current and former officials’, without naming any, and even admits that those sources “did not say whether Mr. Trump himself…has pressured the intelligence agencies.”

Indeed, the only named source in the piece is Anthony Ruggiero, the head of the National Security Council’s bureau tracking weapons of mass destruction.

The Times claims that Ruggiero “expressed frustration during one videoconference in January that the C.I.A. was unable to get behind any theory of the outbreak’s origin.”

That’s literally it. One comment from someone in January.

Of course, the leftist blogs didn’t actually read beyond the headline, instead concocting their own posts proclaiming that Trump pressured intelligence officials to blame the Wuhan lab, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, US intelligence issued a statement saying that American agencies are still investigating the lab leak theory, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again reiterated that the Communist Chinese government is refusing to allow the US access to the facilities.

At the same time China, which continues to claim that the virus was intentionally released by the US military, suggested that the US has a ‘history of bacteriological warfare’.

A propaganda piece in China’s state newspaper China Daily falsely claimed that the United States used biological weapons during the Korean War.

“[T]he media outlets that prop up a blame game by the world’s single hegemonic power are forgetting that it was the U.S. that is alleged to have engaged in bacteriological warfare against Korean and Chinese soldiers during the Korean War (1950-53) and against the Vietnamese (1955-75),” Rod P. Kapunan, a “Manila-based political analyst,” wrote.

Kapunan also claimed that “It was the US and some other Western powers that framed people in Iraq and Syria for alleged possession of chemical weapons.”

“Yet the country that was the first to confront the coronavirus and the first to successfully combat the new challenge through its own initiative is today being condemned as the cause of the pandemic,” the piece goes on.

It also insinuates that “U.S. politicians feel no shame in ignoring the truth” and that America is experiencing “failure to effectively cope with the pandemic while China manages to curb domestic cases.”"
Two more COVID-19 positive cases in Uttarakhand, total tally 50,. 	"Chennai: DEHRADUN: Two more Covid-19 positive cases surfaced on Monday including a nurse from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh.
Another positive case was of a 28-year-old mother who delivered a baby 3-days ago in Doon Medical College, Dehradun.
Bapu Nagar locality in Rishikesh and Azad Nagar colony in Dehradun have been sealed after the two were found positive for the fatal virus.
People who came in contact with both the confirmed cases have been issued instructions to quarantine themselves at their homes.
Earlier, on April 5, Uttarakhand police chief Anil Raturi had warned Jamaat followers that case of murder and attempt to murder will be registered against them if they fail to come forward.
More than 200 have come forward till date and have requested medical help.
Till date, total of 23 patients of Covid-19 have recovered and were discharged after their reports for the deadly infection was found negative."
Assam Covid-19 recovery rate 77%, but first patient still positive. 	Assam doctors cured and discharged eight more Covid-19 patients from hospitals on Sunday, taking the state’s recovery rate over 75% against 21.09% for the country, but the state’s first positive person has not reversed yet. State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that four each have been discharged from hospitals in Golaghat and Guwahati. Assam so far has 35 positive cases of which 27 have been discharged and one patient has died. “With Sunday’s discharge, we have seven more patients to go, including the first patient, who is continuing treatment at Silchar Medical College because his swab samples are still showing positive results,” Sarma said. The 52-year-old man from Karimganj had contracted the virus duing the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi and was admitted in Silchar medical college and hospital on March 31. He is a cancer patient. “For a state like Assam, the recovery rate of 77 per cent so far will perhaps be seen as an achievement for us,” Sarma said. The state has conducted 7,616 sample tests so far in the six laboratories in the state and of these 35 tested positive and 209 results are still awaited with the remaining being negative. Guwahati Medical College Hospital tested 3,655 samples followed by 1,396 at Assam Medical College and Hospital , Dibrugarh and 1,047 at Fakhruddin Ahmed Medical College Hospital, Barpeta. 
CDC RUSHES OUT PANDEMIC GUIDANCE FOR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AFTER SURPRISE TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT. 	"After weeks of butting heads with the Trump administration over pandemic guidance, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidance on Friday for the reopening of religious institutions.

“Gathering together for worship is at the heart of many faith traditions,” reads a statement from the CDC.

“Because there are several published reports of COVID-19 outbreaks sparked by large gatherings, both non-religious and religious in nature, the recommendations released today will help guide faith communities while respecting their fundamental right to gather for worship.”

Recommendations include;

Encouraging staff and congregants to wash their hands with soap and water
Providing hand sanitizer
No-touch trash cans
Encouraging the use of cloth masks
“Suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing, chanting, or reciting during services,”
Daily disinfection
Social distancing
Limiting the sharing of objects such as books and hymnals
Identify an area to quarantine people with COVID-19 symptoms
If someone in a congregation is diagnosed with COVID-19, perform contact tracing and inform anyone with exposure to the person to stay home and self-monitor
Close off any area used by a sick person and do not use until it has been disinfected – which should be performed at least 24 hours later.
Designate a staff member to handle COVID-19 concerns. The revised guidance comes after President Trump told a Michigan roundtable on Thursday “I said, ‘You better put it out,’” – one day before calling an impromptu press conference where he announced that places of worship would be deemed “essential,” and called for their reopening.

Trump said that he would “override” governors who keep places of worship closed. "
BRONX ER DOCTOR EXPLAINS WHY REOPENING THE ECONOMY NOW MIGHT ACTUALLY SAVE LIVES. 	"Last night, after we reported on a pair of ER doctors arguing that the US states should lift their lockdowns immediately (during the course of their argument, which was mostly rooted in trends they’ve witnessed first hand, they apparently made the error of bringing up ‘personal liberty’ and ‘the Constitution’, words that prompt progressives to stop listening and start squawking about killing grandma to further enrich the billionaires) YouTube decided that their argument constituted ‘misinformation’ about the coronavirus outbreak and deleted the video after it racked up more than 5 million views.

We found that curious, since even doctors and epidemiologists have told mainstream news organizations that our understanding of the virus is still developing, and things we thought weren’t accurate just weeks ago and now being re-examined. One such aspect is the heavy handed lockdown response implemented across the US, and elsewhere. Urban leftists and out-of-touch Silicon Valley billionaires simply don’t understand that there are millions of Americans out there – many of whom happen to be white – who are absolutely terrified about losing their livelihoods, and don’t understand why all of this is necessary to combat a virus that leaves the vast majority of those infected unscathed.

The first rounds of ‘surveillance’ testing in the US, carried out in New York and in California’s Santa Clara County (the Cali effort was part of a private study, while New York State is testing random samples of the population to try and discern how widely spread the virus has already become) have suggested that the number of total cases is much, much higher than official numbers reflect. The most recent data released by Gov. Cuomo suggest that 1 in 4 people in NYC might already be infected, a figure that rises to 40% in some poorer areas like parts of the Bronx, where most workers are ‘essential’.

Many have blamed politicians for sending ‘mixed messages’ to the public, but the truth is, the message has changed along with our understanding and experience dealing with the virus.

And now, an ER doctor at a hospital in the Bronx is arguing that it’s time to reopen the economy, while pointing out that many thousands of unnecessary deaths could result if we don’t reopen quickly enough, as millions of Americans delay or skip critical preventative care, including people with heart disease and other health issues that make doing so particularly dangerous.

Daniel Murphy, an emergency room physician at St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx. Murphy contracted the virus during the early days of the outbreak, and accidentally spread it to members of his family. Luckily, they all quickly recovered and he returned to work in time for the big rush.

Murphy readily acknowledged that the outbreak has been by far the worst public health emergency of his 30-year career in medicine.

COVID-19 has been the worst health-care disaster of my 30-year ­career, because of its intensity, duration and potential for lasting impact. The lasting impact is what worries me the most. And it’s why I now believe we should end the lockdown and rapidly get back to wor.

From mid-March through mid-April, the ER staff at St. Barnabas huddled in groups of about 20 every morning. We asked ourselves what had happened over the previous shift. We generated a list of action­able tasks for the following 24 hours. At first, we addressed personal protective equipment and the management of patients with mild illness who were seeking COVID-19 tests.

Two weeks ago, Murphy said, their ER was slammed with calls, and patients were dying from severe COVID-19 left and right. But as the curve has ‘flattened’ – a trend closely documented by data collected by New York State – Murphy and his team have noticed a massive drop in emergency patients with COVID-19.

Then came the wave of critically ill patients in numbers none of us had ever seen. This lasted for two weeks. The number of patients on ventilators accumulated in the ER and throughout the hospital. We witnessed an unprecedented number of deaths. The tone of the huddles became more somber. We became accustomed to the morbidity; we did our jobs.

It is precisely what I have witnessed that now tells me that it’s time to ease the lockdown. Here’s why.

Then, all of sudden, on April 7 at 1 pm, Murphy noticed that the non-stop parade of ambulances carrying critically ill COVID-19 patients seemed to have stopped suddenly. From that point on, the number of ER admissions started to decline precipitously.

First, the wave has crested. At 1 p.m. on April 7, the COVID-19 arrivals slowed down. It was a discrete, noticeable event. Stretchers became available by 5 p.m., and the number of arriving COVID-19 patients dropped below the number discharged, transferred or deceased.

That drop was “striking”, as the doctor explained, because the community he serves is overwhelmingly poor, and sported high rates of infection. The surveillance data released by NY State so far suggests that the area surrounding the hospital may have seen infection rates climb as high as 40%.

The mechanics of this ebb and flow have led Dr. Murphy to suspect that the lockdowns have actually done little to blunt the ‘peak’, a conclusion that’s supported by Sweden’s policies and outcomes.

This was striking, because the community I serve is poor. Some are homeless. Most work in “essential,” low-paying jobs, where distancing isn’t easy. Nevertheless, the wave passed over us, peaked and subsided. The way this transpired tells me the ebb and flow had more to do with the natural course of the outbreak than it did with the lockdown.

Whatever Murphy’s first-hand experience might suggest about the usefulness of lockdowns, what’s wrong with waiting a few more weeks, just in case he’s wrong? Well, Murphy explains, even if we set aside the economic damage and its long-term ramifications for personal health, there’s an even more urgent issue at hand: Because of the lockdowns, too many Americans are delaying critical non-COVID-19 care.

The problem is that in addition to the drop in coronavirus patients, the hospital has also reported a massive drop in patients of all types and categorizations as more people are apparently staying home despite injuries or symptoms that are probably critical for fear of catching the virus. There’s simply no other explanation for such a statistically significant drop.

Without a doubt, many of those who aren’t healthy but have opted to delay care that could prevent lethal strokes, heart attacks or other diseases.

Second, I worry about non-coronavirus care. While the inpatient units remain busy with sick COVID-19 patients, our ER has been quiet for more than a week. We usually average 240 patients a day. For the last week, we averaged fewer than 100. That means our patients in this diverse, low-income community are afraid to come to the ER for non-COVID care.

Gotham-wide, the number of 911 ambulance runs declined to 3,320 on April 18, down from a peak of 6,527 on March 30, according to New York Fire Department data. The current nadir is significantly below the average.

A large share of those staying home surely have emergency medical and surgical conditions not related to the novel coronavirus. The growing numbers ­dying at home during this crisis must include fatal myocardial infarctions, asthma exacerbations, bacterial infections and strokes.

Another huge problem that has been almost completely ignored is that child vaccination rates have plummeted during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, our pediatric volume in the ER has practically disappeared. Visits to primary-care pediatricians are also down, with vaccine schedules falling behind. Everyone seems to be avoiding the health system — an important and unfortunate consequence of the stay-at-home strategy.

Third, inordinate fear misguides the public response. While COVID-19 is serious, fear of it is being over-amplified. The public needs to understand that the vast majority of infected people do quite well.

And finally, as we noted above, Dr. Murphy argued that the virus is already much more pervasive than official data reflect.

Finally, COVID-19 is more prevalent than we think. Many New Yorkers already have the COVID-19 infection, whether they are aware of it or not. As of today, over 43 percent of those tested are positive in The Bronx. We are developing a significant degree of natural herd immunity. Distancing works, but I am skeptical that it is playing as predominant a role as many think.

There’s no question that testing is “important work”, Dr. Murphy added. But there’s no reason it can’t happen “in parallel” to an economic reopening. And even as it stands, scientists continue to find flaws with tests that call their results into question. All of this will likely take months, if not years to sort out. And we simply can’t wait that long without making the ‘cure’ more damaging than the ‘disease’.

More testing will better establish the numbers among those with mild illnesses and no symptoms. My professional ­experience tells me the number of infected people will be high. Testing is important work, but it should happen in parallel to the immediate resuscitation of the economy and getting people back to work.

At present, the testing is ­imperfect. We can’t wait months. We must protect the vulnerable and mitigate without destroying the economy.

So, will Google and YouTube censor Dr. Murphy, too?"

STUDY: LOCKDOWN “WILL DESTROY AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES MORE YEARS OF HUMAN LIFE” THAN IT SAVES. 	"A study has found that the “stay at home” lockdown order in the United States will “destroy at least seven times more years of human life” than it saves and that this number is “likely” to be more than 90 times greater.

As we have repeatedly highlighted, the untold cost of the lockdown in terms of untreated serious illnesses and the impact on mental health will not be fully known for years, but discussion around the issue has been limited in the mainstream media.

Now a new study finds that debilitating stress and anxiety caused by the lockdown, including turmoil caused by huge job losses, could lead to a plethora of negative health problems that will have a far greater overall toll on human life than the number of lives saved by the lockdown.

“Based on a broad array of scientific data, Just Facts has computed that the anxiety created by reactions to Covid-19—such as stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns, media exaggerations, and legitimate concerns about the virus—will destroy at least seven times more years of human life than can possibly be saved by lockdowns to control the spread of the disease. This figure is a bare minimum, and the actual one is likely more than 90 times greater.”

Research shows that at least 16.8% of adults in the United States have suffered “major mental harm from responses to Covid-19.”

Extrapolating these numbers out, the figures show that “anxiety from responses to Covid-19 has impacted 42,873,663 adults and will rob them of an average of 1.3 years of life, thus destroying 55.7 million years of life.”

This contrasts with “a maximum of 616,590 lives (which) might be saved by the current lockdowns, and the disease robs an average of 12 years of life from each of its victims, which means that the current lockdowns can save no more than 7.4 million years of life.”

The seven times figure is a massively conservative estimate which minimizes the impact of the negative consequences of lockdown and maximizes the number of lives affected by lockdown.

“Under the more moderate scenarios…anxiety will destroy more than 90 times the life saved by lockdowns,” states the study.

The study lists a number of reasons why the lockdown has increased anxiety and depression, one of which includes the media’s role in exaggerating the deadliness of COVID-19 and “using false denominators that exaggerate its death rate.”

“This research is engaging and thoroughly answers the question about the cure being worse than the disease,” concluded Joseph P. Damore, Jr., M.D., who reviewed the study.

As we highlighted earlier, psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, during the lockdown months of March and April compared to January and February."

SLIPPERY SLOPE TO DESPOTISM: PAVED WITH LOCKDOWNS, RAIDS, AND FORCED VACCINATIONS. 	"“You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”—Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us.

OPERATION HAIRCUT: HAIRSTYLISTS TO PROTEST GOV. WHITMER STRIPPING BARBER’S LICENSE FOR REOPENING. 	"A conservative group is organizing a civil disobedience demonstration in Michigan after Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer stripped a barber of his license for trying to reopen his business.

The group, called the Michigan Conservative Coalition, is organizing with dozens of barbers and hairstylists to give haircuts outside the Michigan capitol building on May 20 as an act of defiance against Whitmer’s tyranny.  “To show people we are not unintelligent – the workers and the business owners of Michigan – we all know how to behave in this new world,” said MCC organizer Meshawn Maddock. “There is no reason why barbers and stylists can’t safely cut hair.”

The planned mass demonstration was inspired by 77-year-old barber Karl Manke, who continued to give haircuts despite the shutdown, resulting in Whitmer stripping him of his license earlier this month. “The fact that a 77-year-old barber became a leader in our state (as) the first person brave enough to risk his license, to stand up to our governor,” Maddock said.

“We are proud of him and we were impressed by him. And immediately other hair stylists and barbers reached out to us and said what can I do?”

Manke responded to Whitmer’s action last week, declaring he would not shutter his business because she says so.

“I’m not closing up; I’m not caving in to this,” Manke said, adding: “I’m not a rabble-rouser and I’m not a scofflaw. I’m a small-town barber. I just want to make my living.”"
TUCKER CARLSON: “THE VIRUS ISN’T NEARLY AS DEADLY AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS”. 	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson appeared to join those demanding a move to re-open society as soon as possible when he said during his show last night “the virus isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.”

Carlson questioned why the San Francisco Bay area was expanding its lockdown for another five weeks until the end of May.

“What is the scientific justification for doing that?” he asked. “They didn’t tell us because there is none. None.” Tucker said that “radical steps” necessary to “flatten the curve” were proposed and that curve has now been flattened, “but it’s likely not because of the lockdowns, the virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.”

“It turned out not to be, hospitals never collapsed, outside of a tiny number of places they never came close to collapsing – at least not from an influx of patients,” he concluded.

Carlson’s view that the lockdowns should now be lifted because the virus wasn’t as deadly as first feared is noteworthy because at the beginning of the crisis, he wasn’t one to take coronavirus lightly.

As we highlighted back in mid-March, Carlson reportedly drove to Mar-a-Lago to warn President Trump that the coronavirus outbreak was a massive threat and urged him to take it more seriously."
MEDIA, LEFTISTS FLIP OUT AFTER TRUMP SAYS HE’S TAKING HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. 	"The media spent all night in a frothing fit because President Trump told reporters that he is taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, as a precaution against coronavirus.

Trump told reporter that he hopes not to be taking the medication for long, but that he believes it’s effective, and that “people should be allowed to.”  The media immediately called Trump irresponsible, with some vowing that the drug would “kill him” and anyone else who takes it. Nancy Pelosi seized on the moment to call Trump “morbidly obese”: Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s remarks about hydroxychloroquine “dangerous.”

“Maybe he’s really not taking it because the president lies about things characteristically,” Schumer said on MSNBC.

He added: “I don’t know whether he is taking it or not. I know him saying he is taking it, whether he is or not, is reckless, reckless, reckless.” Even the communist Chinese government got in on the act, claiming that Trump is trying to beat coronavirus with “witchcraft”: It’s not witchcraft, it’s a drug that has proven effective against the virus. Cutting horns off Rhinos and sniffing them is witchcraft"
WHO CLAIMS U.S. AND BRAZIL IGNORED WARNINGS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS. 	"Despite amplifying Chinese propaganda that there was no “human to human” transmission of coronavirus on January 14, a WHO spokesperson today claimed that the U.S. and Brazil ignored warnings about COVID-19.

World Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris was asked during a press conference today about “high case loads” in Brazil and the U.S.

“Around the world we have seen that the warnings we put out right from the start, very, very early on, were not seen as warnings about a very serious, lethal disease,” said Harris.

However, as we highlighted last month, the WHO blocked doctors from urging countries to impose border controls to stop the spread of coronavirus and repeatedly told countries not to close borders, despite this being an effective way of controlling the spread of the virus

In other words, while accusing Brazil and the U.S. of ignoring warnings, the WHO literally ignored the warnings of its own doctors.

Right up until the end of February, the WHO continued “to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks,” despite the rapid spread of the disease.

A Mount Sinai study found that New York City’s record-high coronavirus cases and deaths were “predominately” due to travel from Europe, meaning that many more lives could have been saved if borders had been closed down earlier.

But instead, the WHO insisted that maintaining the globalist principle of the international traffic of people was more important than stopping a global pandemic.

At every step of the way, the WHO praised China’s actions on coronavirus, despite widespread evidence that the virus was leaked from a lab, that Beijing lied about the true fatality numbers and had known about coronavirus at least weeks before it informed the WHO.

On January 14th, the WHO amplified Chinese government propaganda that there had been no “human to human transmission” of COVID-19, despite this having actually occurred back in November.

According to sources who told Fox News that the virus was leaked from a lab in Wuhan, this represented the “costliest government coverup of all time” and “the World Health Organization (WHO) was complicit from the beginning in helping China cover its tracks.”

Over the weekend it was also revealed that German intelligence agency BND has uncovered evidence that Chinese leader Xi Jinping asked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to “suppress news about the Wuhan coronavirus” and that he agreed to do so.

The WHO accusing Brazil and America of ignoring warnings is the height of hypocrisy and once again validates President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw funding from a body that completely botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic."
JOE BIDEN FORGETS WORD FOR ‘CORONAVIRUS’, LOSES TRAIN OF THOUGHT . 	"Democrat presidential frontrunner Joe Biden again stumbled through a television interview that aired Saturday.

At one moment, Biden struggled to remember the name of coronavirus during the recorded Politics Nation appearance. “Everyone who, in fact, gets— is found to have the, uh, the, uh, the COVID, uh, 19 virus,” he told host Al Sharpton.

Another time, Biden awkwardly lost his train of thought. “Look, uh, I, I, I just, if, if— if we hadn’t had the circumstances that occurred last election, we’d have a woman president now,” he said.

“I’d be out campaigning for the reelection of Hillary Clinton.”  In another instance, Biden attacked Trump, but couldn’t remember where he allegedly got his information. His cognitive missteps seemed to come and go, and it could have been because he was, the Trump campaign claimed, reading some answers. "
TRUMP TO SUSPEND ALL IMMIGRATION INTO US OVER CORONAVIRUS. 	"US President Donald Trump said he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States, saying he needs to protect American jobs as coronavirus ravages the economy.

The move, announced in a late-night post on Twitter, effectively achieves a long-term Trump policy goal to curb immigration, making use of the health and economic crisis that has swept the country as a result of the pandemic to do so.

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States,”, Trump said on Monday. He offered no details as to what immigration programmes might be affected by the order. The White House did not immediately elaborate on Trump’s announcement.

The development is the latest in a string of moves cracking down on immigration as the coronavirus spreads in the United States."
VIDEO: CROWD CHEERS AFTER POLICE REFUSE TO ENFORCE NEW JERSEY LOCKDOWN ORDER AT GYM. 	"A New Jersey gym reopened in defiance of Governor Chris Murphy’s shutdown order, and patrons were waiting for the state to respond with a heavy hand.

Atilis Gym co-owner Ian Smith announced his intention to violate the order because he has to run his business to survive.

“We’ll see the reaction from law enforcement, we’ll see the reaction from Governor Murphy,” Smith said. “We’re here, being civilly disobedient, being peaceful, I’m running a business as I should be able to.”  Bellmawr police arrived shortly after, declaring the reopened gym violated Murphy’s shutdown order — then told the crowd to enjoy their day.

“We are and were ordered here today for everybody’s safety, we planned for the worst and hoped for the best, and it looks like that’s what he have out here today,” the officer said.

“Normally, you’re all in violation of the executive order,” he continued. “On that note, have a good day, everybody be safe.”  The crowd immediately erupted into applause and cheers of “USA! USA! USA!”

The Democrats’ extended lockdowns are becoming so indefensible that even law enforcement is beginning to refuse to go along with them.

GEORGIA’S REOPENING A ‘GREAT SUCCESS’. 	"Well, would you look at that.

Three weeks have passed since Georgia started reopening its economy, and the feared apocalyptic resurgence in the coronavirus that was supposed to overwhelm the state’s health-care system and cost thousands of lives hasn’t come to pass.

And many of the same experts who warned against reopening the state “prematurely” – a group that includes Dr. Tony Fauci – are now conspicuously silent.

Meanwhile, other experts have pointed out that Georgia’s reopening, along with the reopenings of others states like Tennessee, South Carolina and Texas, has so far worked out.

Bloomberg reports:

And if Georgia’s reopening has been a success so far, then in theory, “no state is going too fast.”

Some Wall Street economists say a continued decline in serious illnesses suggests Georgia’s reopening may encourage other states to ease restrictions and lead to an eventual resumption in economic activity in the US.

“Georgia is a bellwether mainly because the reopening has been so aggressive,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC, who cited in a research note Wednesday an almost 20% drop in Georgia’s Covid-19 patients in the past week or so.

“The other aggressive states, like Florida and Texas, are still opening up more slowly,” Stanley said in an interview. “So if Georgia is successful then, in theory, no one is going too fast – there should be a strong presumption that reopenings everywhere else should be successful.”

Kemp lifted a state order on April 24, allowing nail salons, hairdressers, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen so long as they followed state protocols. Restaurants and theaters were given the go-ahead three days later.

The same goes for other states, because, although the NYT has repeatedly pointed out that, when backing out the data from the Greater NY area, the curve still appears to be gradually steepening, and even though Texas reported a “record” daily jump in deaths on Thursday (data reported with a 24 hour delay), in reality, the number of cases and states remains relatively low per capita, and there are still counties across the midwest, south and mountain west haven’t reported a single case or death.

Some have attributed a recent bump in some of the less-impacted areas to an improvement in the availability of testing.

To be sure, as BBG explains, it’s too early to declare “Mission Accomplished”. Georgia has suffered a lot, but even as hospitalizations and the spread slow, a new “hot spot” of cases has emerged north of Atlanta, and the risk of spread remains moderate.

But one thing is clear: A few weeks ago, the mayor of Atlanta, and several other Democratic mayors of the state’s largest cities, slammed Kemp and implied that he was putting lives at risk for the sake of the president’s reelection campaign.

At the time, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was “dumbfounded” and “extremely concerned” by the decision.

But here’s the thing: Just as Kemp expected, most businesses didn’t reopen right away. Indeed, three weeks in, some small businesses and even some chains have yet to reopen (most Apple stores in the US remain closed, for example, though five stores have reopened, one of which is in South Carolina).

SIXTH NAME ON NYT’S LIST OF ‘CORONAVIRUS VICTIMS’ IS 27-YR-OLD MAN WHO WAS MURDERED. 	"Sixth Name On NYT's List Of 'Coronavirus Victims' is 27-Yr-Old Man Who Was Murdered
Researchers only had to go six names in to the New York Times’ long list of nearly 100,000 “coronavirus victims” to find a person who was murdered rather than killed by the virus. Folks are speculating the Times just searched obits for terms like COVID-19 and ran with whatever they found.  Dr. Birx said in April that the government was taking a “very liberal approach” to labeling who died from the coronavirus. KOMO News reported last week that officials in Washington state included deaths from gunshot wounds in their state’s official “COVID-19 death count.”"
HOT MIC MOMENT AT CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE BRIEFING!!!. 	"A new study from the Los Angeles County Public Health suggests that approximately 221,000 to 442,000 adults have already had COVID19.

With just over 1,072 alleged confirmed deaths, this suggests that the actual morbidity rate for COVID19 is somewhere between 0.0048% and 0.0024%, far less deadly than projected.

During the April 20th Coronavirus Task Force Press Briefing at the White House, there was a hot mic moment.

Fox News’ John Roberts can be seen and heard discussing this new study openly with other members of the press.

Shocked upon hearing these new coronavirus statistics, one voice can clearly be heard asking “so it was a hoax?”"
COVID-19: POLICE HOST PUBLIC MANHUNT FOR WOMAN ‘VIOLATING THE RULES AND ORDERS FOR FAILURE TO QUARANTINE’. 	"A Hawaiian Police Department recently posted to Facebook about a woman who was on the run for flouting coronavirus social distancing rules.

The Maui Police Department had resorted to Facebook to carry out a manhunt for a young woman who was suspected of breaching social distancing as local authorities scramble to prevent the further spread of the deadly coronavirus.

On the police department’s Facebook page, as they searched for the suspect, they wrote: Police are requesting your assistance in locating Tara Trunfio. Trunfio is wanted for violating the Rules and Orders for failure to quarantine. Trunfio is described as a 24 year old, Caucasian female, height 5’11”, weight 155 lbs., with brown hair and hazel eyes. She was last seen in Haiku, and may now be in the Kihei area. Anyone with information is asked to please contact the Maui Police Department.

On May 16, the department issued an update to the original post notifying social media users that the social distancing fugitive was remanded in police custody, thanking them for their assistance.

The update read:

On May 16, 2020 at about 2:31 a.m., Tara Trunfio (23) of Colorado, was arrested for two (2) counts of Rules and Orders.

Investigation reveals that Trunfio arrived on Maui, acknowledged the Emergency Proclamations set forth by Governor David Ige and Mayor Michael Victorino with regards to the Traveler 14 Day Quarantine, however failed to comply.

The Maui Police Department went onto add:

An all-points bulletin was put out for her arrest, and posted to social media. There were over 300,000 people reached with the post and over 5,000 comments, some positive and some negative.

On May 16, 2020 at about 1:40 a.m., police were dispatched to a residence in Kula, regarding a female later identified as Trunfio, on the property refusing to leave.

Maui Police Department will continue to enforce the rules and orders set forth by the Governor of the State of Hawaii, Mayor of Maui County, and Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Trunfio’s bail is set at $4,000.00. She remains in police custody as of May 16, 2020 at 9:45 a.m.

The updated Facebook post, which has gone viral after being shared nearly 3,000 times, was not tremendously well-received by its 8,000+ commenters.

Most of the people who viewed the post voiced their disapproval of the measures taken by the Police Department.

The Police Department was compared to totalitarian mid-20th century political regimes.

Across the pond, in the UK, the police have come under immense fire after several different images have circulated social media showing potential overreach.

One man had his front door kicked in after reports that he was hosting a party–thereby breaching social distancing–had emerged. With a gung-ho attitude, the police, failing to wear any protective gear, cavalierly charged into the lone man’s apartment as he filmed them searching the premises for non-existent revelers.

During a confrontation with the police, a defiant but innocent man wasthreatened to have charges made up by police in order to bring him in. The video went viral on social media and the Police Department responsible was forced to suspend the officer in question and to issue a statement."
VIDEO: WOMAN DRIVEN OUT OF GROCERY STORE BY ANGRY MOB FOR NOT WEARING A MASK. 	"Video: Woman Driven Out of Grocery Store by Angry Mob For Not Wearing a Mask
Video footage out of Staten Island shows a woman being driven out of a grocery store by an angry mob because she’s not wearing a mask.

The clip shows the woman surrounded by other shoppers as they yell and cuss at her.

“Get the fuck outta here” and “get out” the crowd screams at the woman while pointing towards the exit. “The viral video is part of a wave of social shaming on Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites, aimed at people not wearing face masks in public places,” reports Newsweek.

New Yorkers have been required to wear masks inside grocery stores and while using public transport since April 17.

Reaction to the video was mixed, with some decrying the actions of the mob but others vehemently supporting their behavior.

“Cool. Finally. Cuz at this point, a maskless person in an indoor place is like a shooter pointing his gun at me,” commented one respondent.

“Not wearing a mask during a pandemic is like not wearing a seatbelt in a car,” claimed another.

As we highlighted earlier, in Italy the left-wing government has announced it will recruit 60,000 citizen snitches to enforce “social distancing.”

In the United States, it looks like that won’t be necessary, as an army of volunteer Karens are willing to perform the same role for free."
All because of them: Pakistani cleric blames women for Covid-19. 	"A well-known cleric in Pakistan has said the coronavirus pandemic has been unleashed on humanity because of the “wrongdoing of women” and he made the comments in the presence of Prime Minister Imran Khan on live television.
According to news agency ANI, Maulana Tariq Jameel made the comments during the Ehsaas Telethon fundraising event on Thursday as Imran Khan looked on.
Reports said the cleric blamed women who “were often scantily dressed” for the spread of the coronavirus disease in the country. He condemned them and said their behaviour was bringing such wrath upon the country.
Jameel had also condemned the media for what he said was disseminating lies but later apologised for that remarks, saying it was a slip of tongue.
However, he did not apologise was made for his offensive remarks on women.

Beaumont COVID-19 antibody test of staff reveals 20% were positive, asymptomatic . 	"Beaumont COVID-19 antibody test of staff reveals 20% were positive, asymptomatic .  COVID-19 antibody testing of staff at the Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center has revealed that 20% of those tested positive were asymptomatic of the virus, according to a press release Sunday from UMass Memorial Medical Center.
The staff voluntarily underwent the testing for the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of 80 staff members tested, 16 tested positive.
The Beaumont facility is now a temporary COVID-19 care and treatment center.
Those findings likely mean the caregivers had a mild infection from coronavirus and were able to mount an immune response against it, or may have previously been infected with a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2, the press release said.
All caregivers at the facility will be informed of their test results by phone or mail this week. In addition to informing the caregivers of their results, the letter will also remind caregivers — whether testing positive or negative — to not change their behavior because of their individual results and to continue to exercise standard infection control precautions while at work, outside of work, and in their homes.
Typically, immune responses to a virus confer some degree of protection from being infected from the same virus again though there is not enough information to know if this is the case with COVID-19. Antibody testing is frequently used to understand what percentage of a population has been exposed to a virus.
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in hard hit areas of the U.S., such as in Chelsea outside Boston, where 30 percent of people who were tested were found to be positive for antibodies, and New York state — where 16% tested positive — were random samples and not specifically focused on health care workers, the press release said.
“Understanding the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an important tool in our fight against COVID-19. We are so grateful to the Beaumont staff for being the first skilled nursing facility in the state to dedicate itself to caring for COVID-19 patients,” said Eric W. Dickson MD, President and CEO of UMMHC the provider of the testing. “Without them, we would not be able to keep up with the number of patients we are caring for with COVID-19. It seemed only fitting to offer them the opportunity to be tested first.”
UMass Memorial intends to offer free testing to some of its caregivers as increased testing capacity becomes available. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is currently available locally at CareWell Urgent Care Centers."
Holistic Tips For Building A Stronger Immune System Against Covid-19. 	"Since I was a little girl I’ve been a die hard fanatic of fried chicken, I mean I could literally eat it everyday, not quite sure what the high in cholesterol, oily,magic meat did for me but but boy did it do it!! Even as a vegetarian today smelling the hypnotic smell of its potent fragrance, with in conjunction to the sound of its sizzling patterns from the frying pan can send me straight into a frenzy storming out the front of any kitchen door in extreme frustration, weak in temptation, and fully engaged in a conscious battle between the unhealthy devil on the left side of my shoulder and the little angel full of life and vitality on the right.
Nonetheless, in today’s time I’ve more so been wondering why haven’t so many other minorities and people with comprised immunity’s haven’t switched over to a meatless diet with less salt and starch? Especially with the media constantly announcing the heightened risk of limited survival of Covid-19 for those with comprised or weak immune systems. There are a number of things we can do to boost our immunity, one that doesn’t get a lot of widespread media is fasting, fasting rebuilds and regenerates cells, fasting adds years on your life, fasting also detoxify’s the body and blood, and is also known for curing and riding the body of all kinds of illness’es and diseases. I’m going on my second year of fasting, some would call my methods of fasting extreme as I like to fast generally twice a month on periods of 5 day increments. If you find this to be a bit much (because it is in the beginning) I definitely had my fair share of trail and errors, you can try intermediate fasting, which one example is leaving a 8 hour window open for meals with hours consisting of 1 pm -9 pm and using the rest of the 16 hours of your day to fast. The beautiful thing about fasting is it’s versatility, you can incorporate any type of method to your fast you’d like!
Also, another great tip on building up immunity is incorporating essential oils into your daily regime, eucalyptus, frankincense, and oregano are some of the top essentials oils for reducing inflammation, extensive scientific study’s have found a direct link between Frankincense’s ability to lower inflammation and an enhanced immunity.
Inflammation is just your body’s way of formulating illness. Heart disease, and respiratory infections are all just a over flow of inflammation to those specific parts of the body, even dementia is caused by inflammation in the brain. Eucalyptus might be my fave out of all three, not only does it provide instant relief, but it also provides a soothing calming effect especially good for balancing better sleep patterns. The secret to its effectiveness is a compound called 1, 8-cineole, which has powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, and anti-bacterial properties. Oregano is just as powerful as it is a natural antibiotic, it also lowers cholesterol, and it also known for its ability to prevent cold symptoms from worsening. Balancing a healthy diet full of vitamin c is also in essential in balancing immunity. Believe it or not I haven’t had a cold in close to 4 years! Long before this pandemic I’ve incorporated protecting my hands when touching public doors and gas pumps etc.

NOT WORTH MY TIME! TRUMP CANCELS DAILY BRIEFING. 	"President Donald Trump has declared that the White House news conferences were ‘not worth the time and effort’ because the ‘Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions.’

An embattled Trump took to his favorite social media platform on Saturday to slam ‘fake news’ and to cancel the White House press briefings.

‘What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,’ he asked in the Saturday tweet. ‘They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!’ Trump followed up with a declaration that he never called the pandemic a ‘hoax’ during a rally in South Carolina.

‘I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax,’ he said. ‘They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!’ Prior to the tweets, the White House called the press pool and announced that the press briefing was cancelled.

In the absence of his campaign rallies, the president has relished the opportunity to take the lead during the televised afternoon updates, which have stretched for as long as two hours as Trump boasts achievements against the outbreaks and applauds the high television rating the briefings receive."
FBI RAIDS DETROIT-AREA MEDICAL FACILITY ‘FOR USING INTRAVENOUS VITAMIN C TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS’. 	"The FBI on Thursday raided a Detroit-area medical facility for reportedly treating non-hospitalized coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C, which the FBI appears to be claiming is a “fraudulent treatment.”

Allure Medical Spa, which is owned by Dr. Charles Mok, had been giving out vitamin C injections for free to first responders before the FBI came in and aggressively shut him down. From Click on Detroit, “Macomb County business raided by the FBI over possible improper COVID-19 treatments”:

FBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.

On April 18, Allure’s Facebook page had a post that said “At Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.”

That post, as well as a post on Allure Medical’s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down.

After talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.

Dr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said “What I’m finding in practice — I treat a lot of COVID patients — is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.”

While it may not be a “cure,” vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.

FOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a “fake treatment” and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing “fraudulent treatments for COVID-19” and allegedly “did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.” FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is “ahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients’] health first, often treating them for free.”

“Vitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,” the doctor said.

“I’ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,” one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.

“The FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,” FOX 2 Detroit reported.

Here’s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:

Allure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees

Allure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. “We are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples’ immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,” says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.

Intravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 – Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS – COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.

If you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19.

In addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.

The only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they’re using it to “help those with the virus recover quicker.”

It hasn’t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.

Raiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.

Could this dispute not have been solved with a simple letter or a phone call?"

It’s a tragedy not because they suffer material want; indeed, relatively few suffer so, because government assistance satisfies many of their material needs.

It’s tragic because one of the keys to human happiness is earned self-respect, which requires, as Charles Murray has written, making one’s own way in the world. The vast majority of poor people don’t want welfare; they don’t want handouts; they want a good job with which they can support themselves and their families comfortably. The tragedy of the American welfare system is that it traps so many people in dependency on government, by hindering them from getting on and climbing up the job ladder, and thereby earning self-respect and happiness.

*  *  *

Our fear now, confirmed by excellent research from  Kathy Morris & Chris Kolmar at Zippia.com, is that the ‘generosity’ of the CARES Act (and the fact that politicians are loathed to remove any policy that could possibly make their voters upset) has the potential to create an entire new generation of welfare serfs, subsisting on significant welfare benefits with no incentive to ‘get back to work’, even after the lockdowns are lifted.

DoubleLine’s CEO Jeff Gundlach appears to agree… And now, as BizPacReview.com’s Vivek Saxena details below,  a Washington State business owner faced backlash from her employees after she obtained a forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loan from the federal government that has allowed her to keep them fully paid through the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interview with CNBC this week, salon owner Jamie Black-Lewis of the Oasis Medspa & Salon in Woodinville and Amai Day Spa in Bothell said her employees were furious because they were already “making” more money being unemployed.

And the reason they were “making” more being unemployed was because of a Democrat-pushed provision that was added to the CARES Act.

The provision added “a flat $600 a week to the typical weekly benefits paid by one’s state,” CNBC reported. “Those traditional benefits, which vary widely between states, replaced about 40% of one’s prior wages.”

“The measure’s improved $600-a-week payments, which run through July, aim to boost that wage replacement rate to 100% for the average worker. But some, especially lower-wage workers, can come out ahead.”

And that’s exactly what happened in Black-Lewis’s case, just as congressional Republicans had repeatedly warned. “It’s a windfall they see coming,” Black-Lewis said of the unemployment benefits her employees were slated to “earn.”

“In their mind, I took it away. I couldn’t believe it. On what planet am I competing with unemployment?

“It was a firestorm of hatred about the situation,” Black-Lewis said.

On a planet that contains naive Democrats, no doubt …

Included among the many Republicans who spoke out last month against the inclusion of the Democrat-pushed provision were Sens. Rick Scott and Tim Scott.

“We have a virus and we know people can’t work for a variety of reasons,” Rick Scott said at the time.

“We got to help them, but at the moment we go back to work, we cannot create an incentive not to work. We cannot be paying people more money on unemployment than they get paid in their job.”

“[W]e cannot encourage people to make more in unemployment than in employment,” Tim Scott added.

“This legislation would not stop at 100 percent of your income. This legislation would allow people to make more in unemployment than in employment.”

In response to Republicans’ logical rebuttals, congressional Democrats and their left-wing media allies pounced with hysteria and smears: Republicans are more worried about what unemployed & impoverished Americans will do with an extra $600 during a financial crisis than they are with what billion dollar companies will do with billions of dollars with little oversight & no strings attached

— Adam Blickstein (@AdamBlickstein) March 25, 2020 . As the repercussions of the Democrat-pushed measure were becoming more apparent a couple of weeks later in mid-April, Sen. Lindsey Graham warned that it needed to be fixed.

“Here’s the problem: The unemployment benefits in South Carolina are $23/hour to be unemployed,” he said during an appearance on Fox News last week.

“You’ve got a lot of small businesses trying to keep their employees on the payroll paying $16 and $17/hour. One program is undercutting the other. We’ve got to get that fixed.”"
NEXT IN CORONAVIRUS TYRANNY: FORCED VACCINATIONS AND ‘DIGITAL CERTIFICATES’. 	"In my first week in the House of Representatives in 1976, I cast one of the two votes against legislation appropriating funds for a swine flu vaccination program.

A swine flu outbreak was then dominating headlines, so most in DC were frantic to “do something” about the virus.

Unfortunately, the hastily developed and rushed-into-production swine flu vaccine was not only ineffective, it was dangerous.

Approximately 50 people who received the vaccine subsequently contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome, a potentially fatal form of paralysis.

According to an expert with the Centers for Disease Control, the incidence of Guillain-Barré was four times higher among those who received the swine flu vaccine than in the general population.  That sad history may soon repeat itself. Right now, governments and private industries are working to rapidly develop and deploy a coronavirus vaccine. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is a major funder of these efforts, has suggested everyone who receives a vaccine be issued a “digital certificate” proving he has been vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose record of wrong predictions makes him the Bill Kristol of epidemiology, also wants individuals to carry some proof they have been vaccinated.

Another authoritarian proposal floated to deal with coronavirus is to force everyone to download a phone app that will track their movements. This would allow government officials to identify those who may have been near anyone who may have had coronavirus. Such mandatory “contact tracing” is an assault on our privacy and liberty.

Vaccines can improve health. For example, vaccines helped reduce the incidence of diseases like polio. But not all vaccines are safe and effective for all people. Furthermore, certain modern practices, such as giving infants multiple vaccines at one time, may cause health problems. The fact that vaccines may benefit some people, or even most people, does not justify government forcing individuals to be vaccinated. It also does not justify vaccinating children against their parents’ wishes. And it certainly does not justify keeping individuals and families in involuntary quarantine because they do not have “digital certificates” proving they have had their shots.

If government can force individuals to receive medical treatment against their will, then there is no reason why government cannot force individuals to buy medical insurance, prohibit them from owning firearms, dictate their terms of employment, and prevent them from taking arguably harmful actions like smoking marijuana or drinking raw milk. Similarly, if government can override parents’ wishes regarding medical treatment for their children, then there is no reason why government cannot usurp parental authority in other areas, such as education.

Proponents of mandatory vaccines and enhanced surveillance are trying to blackmail the American people by arguing that the lockdown cannot end unless we create a healthcare surveillance state and make vaccination mandatory. The growing number of Americans who are tired of not being able to go to work, school, or church, or even to take their children to a park because of government mandates should reject this “deal.” Instead, they should demand an immediate end to the lockdowns and the restoration of individual responsibility for deciding how best to protect their health."
Covid-19 trial firm Synairgen is up 955%. Here’s what I’d do now. 	"AIM-listed biotech firm Synairgen (LSE:SNG) has been on a rocket ride since markets crashed in March 2020. In fact, the share price is nearly 1,000% higher than it was at the beginning of January.
The real kicker came on 18 March. On this day, the FTSE 100 , S&P 500 , Dow Jones and practically every other world stock market index plummeted. But SNG shot up because of a release that detailed how the company’s wholly-owned SNG001 treatment would be trialled on coronavirus patients.
SNG001 is an inhaled version of the antiviral protein interferon-beta-1a. In its injectable form, under the brand name Avonex , the drug is produced by NASDAQ-listed Biogen and used to treat symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The Synairgen formulation is converted into a fine spray and delivered to the lungs in much the same way as asthma medication.
Covid-19 in 2020 Looking at a short-term chart of the Synairgen share price I can see very many peaks and troughs. This says to me that the market is unsure of its true fair value.
It’s only natural in the middle of a global pandemic for investors to consider buying companies with potential Covid-19 treatments.
The medical world is racing to find treatments and vaccines for the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Clearly there is a newly-urgent need to assess new treatments for the respiratory illness that can occur as a result.
But I would warn that such investments come with significant strings attached.
At a market cap of £75m Synairgen is about the smallest-sized company I’d be happy to trade shares in. At this level, liquidity is likely to be poor. This means there might not always be sellers available when you want to buy, or buyers when you want to sell.
The good, the bad, the ugly The Synairgen board of directors is stacked full of pharma heavyweights. These include non-exec director Dr Bruce Campbell, a visiting professor in pharmacology at King’s College London, and chief scientific officer Dr Phillip Monk, a respiratory disease specialist.
I’ve written on other Covid-19 related companies recently, like Novacyt and Omega Diagnostics. The first of these has seen its share price grow by 2,750% since the start of January.
But investing in unproven firms is a dangerous game for long-term investors. For every success there are many more companies that cannot follow through on their promises. And the smaller the firm, the more issues it will have with scale. If governments suddenly want 10m of their treatments, there would be huge manufacturing and supply chain challenges.
The process of bringing drugs to market is also long, slow and expensive. Costs are high for medical research companies as they have to invest significant sums in clinical trials and stringent regulatory requirements.
So when we look back through the balance sheets for Synairgen over the last five years we can see uneven revenue and profits. For example, 2017’s annual revenue was £5.03m, with £1.63m in pre-tax profit. In 2018 revenues were £100,000 with a pre-tax loss of £4.1m.
I’d say an investment would be fine for seasoned traders and those who know their biotech inside and out.
For retirees and novices, I would urge more caution. If you intend to sit on an investment for 10 years, you could be left holding shares at a loss when everyone else has scarpered.

'I'm not going to make it through': Critical with COVID-19 while 30 weeks pregnant, Ohio nurse overcomes despair. 	"Anne Saker Cincinnati Enquirer USA TODAY NETWORK Sunday Apr 26, 2020 at 8:01 AM Apr 26, 2020 at 12:49 PM
Megan Sites landed in a hospital this month critically ill with COVID-19, fighting for every breath. She also was seven months pregnant with her second child. For more than one bad moment, a thought tormented her: She could die.
Sites, 27, of Celina, is a labor and delivery nurse at Joint Township District Memorial Hospital in St. Marys near Grand Lake St. Marys about 100 miles northwest of Columbus.
In late March, Sites felt feverish. She developed a cough. She tested negative for flu, and because she is a health care worker, she was screened March 29 for the new coronavirus. The county health department called her the next day with bad news.
Sites wept. “I can't get sick,” she said.
She consulted with her midwife.
“I was between a rock and hard place,” she recalled.
Antibiotics for COVID-19 could endanger her pregnancy, and she couldn't use a steroid for a preterm delivery because that has been shown to aggravate COVID-19.
On April 1, an anxious Sites went to Joint Township's emergency department struggling to breathe, unable to lie flat. Testing found her lungs clotted with disease. She was awake when the doctors put her on a ventilator, and she felt the tube scrape into her trachea. Then her hospital sent her to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton.
She improved, the breathing machine was removed, but “within 24 hours, 48 hours, my condition completely worsened.”
Visitor restrictions at hospitals due to the pandemic kept husband Donny, her parents, her in-laws, her friends from her side. Alone, Sites worried about the future.
“I had a few breakdown moments. I told myself, 'This is it, I'm not going to make it through,'” she said. “Everything in my body, it hurt to breathe, to move, to cough, to anything, it hurt.""
She asked to go back on the ventilator. This time, she asked for sedation.
On April 8, the Miami Valley doctors told Donny Sites, a Mercer County deputy sheriff, that they hoped that because of his wife's youth and overall good health, the ventilator could get her pregnancy to 30 weeks.
Twenty minutes later, the doctors called back. One of Megan's lungs had collapsed. She was near death. There was a chance to save her. But they had to deliver the baby the next day.
* * *
At the same time, Megan's doctors sought help from UC Health, the Cincinnati area's academic health center.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a “near-last resort,” said Dr. Suzanne Bennett, a UC Health critical care anesthesiologist and associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at the UC College of Medicine.
The ECMO device temporarily replaces the heart and lungs for patients and can treat some people with COVID-19's severe lung damage.
UC Health had never put a pregnant woman on an ECMO machine through the pandemic, but Sites was a good candidate.
The machine and a medical team were flown in a helicopter 50 miles to Miami Valley Hospital as Sites went into surgery to deliver her son by cesarean section at 29 weeks and six days. The baby was whisked to neonatal intensive care.
Then surgeons inserted a port into one of Sites' veins that diverted her blood into the ECMO machine and through a membrane that acts like a lung, removing carbon dioxide and refreshing the blood with oxygen. The blood went back into her body via a port in another vein.
The doctors also inserted a tube into her collapsed lung. Sites was still on the ventilator, too. They turned her face down to allow her ribs more freedom as she breathed.
Still sedated, her C-section wound merely packed, Sites was loaded onto an ambulance with the ECMO machine for the ride to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.
Five days on the ECMO machine allowed for healing, and Megan Sites had “an incredibly remarkable recovery,” Bennett said, “improving much faster than most people we've seen in this condition.”
When the ECMO machine was removed, Megan needed several days to shake off the week of sedation. Then a nurse asked whether Megan knew where she was.
“Dayton,” Megan Sites replied.
“No,” she remembered the nurse saying. “You're in Cincinnati, and we had to take the baby.”

Due to the hospital visitation restrictions, four days passed before Donny Sites got to see his son, Jameson Ivan Leroy Sites. He took pictures that family members and friends got blown up and gave to hospital nurses, who set them up in Megan's room.
Megan gazed at those photographs as the nurse explained how she had delivered her son. It felt surreal to her. Her family had details: Jameson had arrived at 3 pounds, 9 ounces and 17&frac12; inches, in good health. He has twice has tested negative for the new coronavirus.
“Watching her FaceTime with her family and new baby left us all with a renewed sense of hope for others battling the disease,” Bennett said.
The doctor credited Megan's recovery to the collaboration between the hospitals. “This lady,” Bennett said, “is alive because of a lot of people.”
On Tuesday, Megan Sites rolled out of the hospital in a wheelchair, discharged, as doctors and nurses applauded her. She and her husband drove right to Jameson's bedside, where a NICU nurse scooped him up and lay him in his mother's arms for the first time.
“It just completed my puzzle. I knew I had had a baby, but until you ...,” and she paused. “It's hard to explain. But then I got to hold him, and it was real for me, that this is my son, and he's perfect."""
All COVID-19 patients in Wuhan discharged. 	People who have recovered from COVID-19 learn to practice the Eight-section Brocade, a traditional Chinese qigong exercise, from a medical worker at the Hubei Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, on April 21. 
AMERICA HAS BECOME “THE LAND OF THE SNITCHES” DURING THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. 	"For those that wondered if Americans would be willing to report on their neighbors on a widespread basis during a major crisis, you now have your answer.

All over the country, calls have been pouring in to authorities from “concerned citizens” that are quite eager to point a finger at their neighbors for violating the coronavirus lockdowns.

In fact, it has been reported that some very nosy people in the state of California were actually calling 911 to report that their neighbors were coughing inside their own homes. Of course the mainstream media is not exactly helping matters when they use phrases such as “death sentence” to describe this pandemic.

Yes, we should all be taking this virus very seriously, but the truth is that this is not the end of the world and everyone needs to calm down.

Do we really want to have a society where everyone is spying on their neighbors?  When I read that a mother in Wisconsin had been visited by the police because she had permitted her daughter to go play at a friend’s house, it really touched a nerve with me…  A Wisconsin mom videotaped two police officers who showed up at her home and accused her of “allowing” her daughter to play at a friend’s house, an act they deemed to be in defiance of Wisconsin’s “Stay at Home” order.

The officers are clearly agitated and condescending in their conversation with the mother, who is addressed as “Amy” when she opens the door upon their arrival.

So how did the police know that her daughter had gone to another house to play?

Needless to say, someone snitched on her.

And this next story is truly bizarre.  A Colorado woman named Heather Silchia was deeply alarmed when she discovered that her “neighbors” had put a really nasty note on her vehicle…

The missive read, “PLEASE STAY HOME. I noticed a few days a week you leave home with your baby and return a short time later without it. Then I see the man of the house arrive with the baby later in the afternoon while your vehicle hasn’t moved all day. This leads me to believe that the kid is in daycare.”

The letter continued, “Stop. I am assuming that man has an essential job since he is gone all day but if you are home there is no reason for your child to be in daycare at a time like this. I also see you leave shortly after your husband (I assume) gets home. You aren’t wearing any sort of uniform and I have never seen you wear a mask. Bars are closed and you couldn’t possibly be getting groceries every night (which would also require you to wear a mask) so I again ask you to please stay home.”

Well, it turns out that Heather Silchia is actually a 911 dispatcher, and that is why she can’t watch her baby all day.

And we should be thankful for front line workers like her, because they are so greatly needed during a time like this.

Sadly, the examples that I have just shared with you are not isolated incidents.  In fact, it has been revealed that there are hundreds of people that have been snitching on their neighbors in the state of Missouri alone…

Hundreds of people have been exposed for reporting people who have flouted social distancing rules and some are now scared they could receive a backlash. The names and addresses of approximately 900 people in Missouri were released as part of a media request under the Sunshine Law, which allows for the release of information submitted to a public agency (except for wrongdoing and abuse tips).

St. Louis County had urged the community to share details of anyone not following guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic and noted in the terms and conditions that information may be shared publicly. However some people may not have read the small print submitted tips via an online form and email from the end of March. Many had asked for their communications to remain private.

If things are this bad in Missouri, one can only imagine the level of snitching that is happening in New York or California.

And even though some states are starting to gradually lift their “shelter-in-place” orders, the truth is that our society is going to be dealing with “social distancing” for a long time to come.  In fact, the way that we share many of our public spaces is in danger of being permanently redefined…

New designs for eating places. McDonald’s is already prototyping a socially distanced version of its restaurant that could be a template for fast-food spaces around the world.

Checkerboard grids on the grass in parks, with people allowed to occupy one square only if those surrounding it are empty.

Or time-sharing of public places: If you don’t show up for your 12:15 p.m. slot at the playground, you’re out of luck.

Are you kidding me?

Of course snitches will have a field day in this sort of an environment.  If you sit too close to a snitch in church or you walk too closely behind a snitch on the sidewalk, you may find yourself explaining your actions to the police.

And what is truly tragic is that none of this nonsense is even necessary.  Please take two and a half minutes and watch this video from Dr. Eric Berg.  It is the most important video about this pandemic that I have watched by a wide margin. After watching the video, I think that you will understand why all of the coronavirus lockdowns should be ended as soon as possible.

Yes, this virus spreads incredibly easily.  But a lot of the people that catch it never show any symptoms at all, and it has become clear that there are things that we can do for those that do become sick to prevent a lot of the really severe cases.

Unfortunately, the mainstream media is not going to tell you the truth.  Instead, they are just going to keep telling you that the death toll projections are going up and that everyone should continue to stay home.

Look, the reality of the matter is that most of the population is eventually going to be exposed to this virus no matter if we have lockdowns or not.  So it is very important to be taking your vitamins and to be doing whatever you can to support your immune system.  And it is also very important to understand that this is not even close to the worst thing that we are going to face.

If we can’t even handle COVID-19, and if the mainstream media won’t even share the truth when scientific studies show absolutely amazing results, what is going to happen to our society when a really severe crisis comes along?"
Covid-19: We’ll Deal With Illegal Immigrants . 	"Foreigners who enter into Ghana within this period when the country’s borders have been closed will severely be dealt with together with their Ghanaian accomplices.
This was announced by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on Sunday, April 26, 2020, when he addressed the nation on measures put in place to curb the spread of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Ghana.
He observed that despite the closures of the borders, some immigrants are able to enter the country illegally. He said most of these people are noted to be carriers of COVID-19.
President Nana Akufo-Addo gave the warning after reports emerged that 17 out of 67 passengers who were intercepted near Nkwanta by officers of the Immigration Service and other security personnel recently for illegally entering the region from Accra during the period of the lockdown, tested positive for COVID-19.
The President in his eight COVID-19 address on Sunday 26th April 2020 expressed his displeasure over how “a few Ghanaians are aiding some West African nationals to enter our country [Ghana] illegally, despite the closure of our borders.”
He warned that “not only will persons who enter our country illegally be strictly dealt with, but so will Ghanaians who facilitate their entry.”
“These are unpatriotic acts and must stop. We cannot continue to allow a few persons, who are motivated by their own selfish, money-making interests, to endanger the lives of the rest of the population.”
The president further called on Ghanaians to be each others keeper during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The President had earlier closed the country’s borders indefinitely as part of measures to fight the Coronavirus.
Ghana’s COVID-19 cases
Ghana’s COVID-19 cases have increased to 1,550 as of Sunday, April 26, 2020.

Covid-19: online games are helping social-distancing Hongkongers kill time, but few willing to pay for it, firms say. 	"Hongkongers are playing video games more than ever due to being stuck at home under the city’s Covid-19 social-distancing rules , but they are also spending less money on them given their pessimism about the economy, according to local gaming companies.
Despite the growth in terms of players, revenue at some local companies has dropped 5% to 15% since the pandemic’s outbreak . That stands in contrast to the global market, which has seen growth in both, two members of the Hong Kong Game Industry Association (HKGIA) said recently.
“During the time of Sars [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in 2003, the number of players and revenues increased by 30% to 40%. But what is special about this outbreak is that it has made many people pessimistic about the future of the economy,” said Jack Lai, chairman of the HKGIA and manager of Chinesegamer International (Hong Kong).
“In this outbreak , many people are afraid of losing their jobs, so it is safer to keep their money in their pockets and try not to spend it on luxuries. I think the business model for our games is very similar to the models for watches or jewellery, which requires spare money.
“Showing off a piece of virtual equipment in a game and showing off a luxurious watch in the real world are the same, and the willingness to show off and spend money is not as strong when players have no confidence in the economy.”
Many online games allow players to enhance their experience by paying real-world dollars to access additional content, boost in-game abilities or make cosmetic improvements to online characters.
Based on exchanges with peers at other companies, Lai estimated overall downloads were up 10% to 20%, while overall revenues were down 5% to 15%, compared with data before the pandemic.
HKGIA has 34 member companies, whose revenues account for 60% to 70% of the market share, according to Lai.
The revenues at his company have fallen 20% to 30% due to the pandemic, Lai added.
The scene in Hong Kong stands in sharp contrast with the global scene, where gaming revenues and downloads are growing. Mobile game downloads rose 20% globally in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, and consumers spent more than US$6.7bil (RM29.20bil) on mobile gaming in the quarter, 5% higher than the three months prior, data from the app analytics firm App Annie shows.
There are two main factors contributing to the drop in revenue in Hong Kong, according to Lai – the overall economic downturn and the postponement of new game releases.
Since many mobile and online games are free to play, many players have no incentive to spend on in-game upgrades, said Sze Lingling, chief operations officer of Gameone Group, one of the largest gaming companies in Hong Kong and an HKGIA member.
“Nowadays people just use games to kill time ... they can get a game and play for a long time,” she said.
The postponement of new releases amid the pandemic has also impacted gaming company revenues.
Chinesegamer International’s new mobile game Heroes Of Huang Yi , based on martial arts-themed stories by Hong Kong novelist Wong Cho-keung, was expected to be released in February or March, but was postponed until June.
Large-scale promotional activities and exhibitions, which account for about half of the company’s publicity plans, are impossible during the pandemic, he said.
Gameone’s new game The Ravages Of Time , adapted from a comic series by Hong Kong artist Chen Mau, has also been postponed until August.
According to the PayPal 2018 Global Gaming report, 90% of Hongkongers play video games at least once a week. – South China Morning Post

Parañaque City shuts illegal Chinese clinics selling COVID-19 ‘medicine’. 	"Authorities raided and shut two Chinese-owned illegal clinics in Parañaque City last night for allegedly selling medicines that purportedly treated the coronavirus.
First to be raided by the police was a Baclaran Village clinic that was located above a milk tea shop. Bearing the sign “Chinese Hospital,” the facility was decked with IV drip stands and sold medicines for three weeks that were neither approved nor checked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reports ABS-CBN News.
Based on English translations of the Chinese labels, most of the drugs were injectables meant to treat HIV , other sexually transmitted diseases, and dengue, Remate reports. Herbal supplements that treated colds, fever, cough, and sore throat, along with non-prescription drugs for flu and other respiratory illnesses were also sold.
“They have all kinds of medicines. I was amazed because most of the medicines I saw were injectables. There were a few oral meds, but there were a lot of IV [intravenous] fluids,” Dr. Olga Virtucio of the Parañaque City Health Office told CNN Philippines.
“There are beds, but not enough to be called a hospital. It’s more of a clinic,” she added.

— Jekki Pascual (@jekkipascual) April 27, 2020
Authorities said they raided the facility after an unidentified informant told them that several Chinese patients visited the clinic to seek a cure for COVID-19.
After the local government shut the clinic, authorities had found a second clinic operated by a Chinese man who claimed to be a licensed medical doctor back in his home country. The clinic was similarly treating patients for the coronavirus, according to the police.

The police are still investigating both clinics and Mayor Edwin Olivarez has asked the Bureau of Immigration to deport the Chinese nationals.
The owners will be charged for violating quarantine laws, medical regulations, and for operating without permits. The seized medicines will be turned over to the FDA for testing.
There is no known cure or vaccine for COVID-19. Experts have estimated that it will take about 18 months to create a reliable vaccine.

Malta looks to start easing COVID-19 measures - Xinhua. 	"Malta is planning to start gradually easing COVID-19 pandemic counter-measures in the coming days after the country registered no new cases, Health Minister Chris Fearne announced on Sunday.
Out of 448 cases detected in Malta since the confirmation of the first case in early March, 282 have recovered, according to the minister.
Addressing a press conference, Fearne said the sacrifices that people had been asked to make in the past few weeks had paid off.
Malta, he said, took a cautious approach from the outset and had rolled out its plan to be hit by a ""river rather than a tsunami"" so that the country's healthcare system could be able to cope with the demand.
""We always said that we should aim to avoid a tsunami of cases and instead turn the spread into a river, and we have managed to achieve that, also because the majority of the Maltese people obeyed the guidelines of the health authorities and adhered to the instructions to stay home and stay safe,"" Fearne said.
He warned that despite the good news, the pandemic was not over yet.
Fearne urged people to continue observing the guidelines that will remain in place for the time being until the health authorities, based on scientific evidence, start to relax some of the measures introduced gradually over the weeks.
He said the measures will see the re-introduction of some of the health services that were stopped to allow the authorities to concentrate on the virus spread. The government will then also see that social life will be gradually restored and economic activity re-activated.
""There could be a second wave so the authorities wanted to make sure that even this hit us slowly so that we can cope with the demand,"" he said.
Replying to questions, Fearne said 28,000 tests had been carried out and the government did not plan to introduce mandatory testing across the population. It was also against using any app that could track people and invade on their privacy.
Speaking in a radio interview concurrently, Prime Minister Robert Abela said the government was looking at achieving the right balance between restoring life to what it was before the pandemic hit and retaining the success it has had so far in its fight.
The key to managing this process was striking a balance between easing off the measures too soon and not waiting too long.
Malta is currently in partial lockdown, with people over 65 and those suffering from certain health conditions not allowed to leave their homes. It banned travel and is only accepting repatriation flights, with anyone arriving having to spend 14 days in mandatory quarantine.
It also introduced several other measures to prevent community spread over the past few weeks, including a ban on being in groups of more than three people unless from the same household, the closure of all schools and the suspension of all religious services and major events.
Court cases were put off and non-essential surgeries postponed. Banks closed some of their branches as a precaution and the government later ordered the closure of non-essential outlets excluding supermarkets, those selling household items and pharmacies.
Malta is also in the process of ordering a prefabricated 90-bed hospital, similar to the one built in Wuhan, China for COVID-19 patients. It will be set up in the grounds of the only state hospital on the island which has already been extended to full capacity in case it is needed. "

The Baby Doll singer has taken to Instagram to share a statement in which she said she is currently at her Lucknow house spending some quality time with her parents.
""Every person that I have come in contact with be it in the UK, Mumbai or Lucknow has shown no symptoms of Covid-19, in fact, all those tested have been negative. I travelled from the UK to Mumbai on March 10 and was duly screened at the international airport. There was no advisory on that day (UK travel advisory was released on March 18) that stated that I needed to quarantine myself,"" she clarifies."

FEAR OF THE CORONAVIRUS HAS ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED AMERICA’S FUTURE. 	"Very few people are talking about it, and even fewer are bothering to object, but by borrowing and spending so much money our politicians are essentially feeding America’s financial future into a wood chipper. 

It took from the founding of our country all the way to 1981 before the U.S. national debt reached one trillion dollars.

Incredibly, we just added more than a trillion dollars to our national debt in less than a month.

On April 5th, we were 23.9 trillion dollars in debt, and by May 4th we were 25 trillion dollars in debt.

Fear of the coronavirus has caused nearly all of our politicians to suddenly become socialists, and we are being told that trillions more in spending may be coming. This is complete and utter lunacy, and we are leaving future generations of Americans with a mountain of debt that would absolutely crush them.

But of course our society may not even last too much longer at the rate we are going.

For years I have been loudly warning that our absurd national debt is an existential threat to America’s future, but at this point both major political parties have completely abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility.

Now our national debt is rapidly speeding toward the 26 trillion dollar mark, and the House of Representatives just passed a bill that would borrow and spend an additional 3 trillion dollars that we do not currently have…

Last week, House Democrats unveiled their latest pandemic-relief package. The bill combines aid for families, a bailout for struggling cities and states, and additional funds for testing, tracing, and hospitals. The price tag is about $3 trillion—and it comes just weeks after the president signed an economic-relief package worth about $2 trillion.

Since we are destroying the nation anyway, why don’t we make the grand total a nice round 10 trillion dollars like the progressives at the Atlantic are suggesting?

After all, we added close to 10 trillion dollars to the national debt during the Obama years and hardly anyone seemed to mind.

Of course Trump is trying to outdo Obama.  We have already added more than 5 trillion dollars to the national debt while he has been in office, and it looks like more “coronavirus relief bills” could be on the way.

Yes, borrowing and spending money that we do not have gives us an economic boost in the present.

But it is also money that we are stealing from future generations, and we are systematically destroying the bright future that they were supposed to have.

Since Barack Obama’s first day in the White House, we have been stealing an average of more than 100 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day.

And under Trump, that pace has actually increased.

I know that figure is difficult to believe, but run the numbers yourself and you will see that I am correct.

What we are doing to future generations is beyond criminal, and it should make every American deeply angry.

But instead, many Americans are convinced that we aren’t spending enough.

In fact, Mark Cuban believes that the government should be issuing $1,000 checks to each household every two weeks…

The federal government has already sent a one-time check of up to $1,200 to millions of American families, but according to Mark Cuban, the stimulus is not enough to offset the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic.

The billionaire entrepreneur proposed the government issue $1,000 checks to every American household every two weeks for the next two months, with the caveat that the money must be spent within 10 days of receipt or it expires. It would cost about $500 billion, Cuban estimated.

Everybody knows that you should never go full Weimar Republic, but since we are essentially doing that already, why not make it $10,000 for every household every two weeks?

After all, $1,000 doesn’t go as far as it once did.  These days, you can blow $1,000 in a single trip to the grocery store.

Of course I am being facetious.  We are literally watching our leaders destroy everything that all previous generations of Americans fought so hard to build, and it is absolutely infuriating.

At this point even the ultra-liberal Washington Post is admitting that “the national debt is out of control”, but of course the Post also keeps on promoting ultra-liberal spending policies.

We are like a morbidly obese guy that can’t even fit in his own bathtub anymore because he is so addicted to food.  Our addiction is debt, and no matter how loud the warnings get we are just going to keep going back for more.

Ultimately, the only way that the U.S. is going to be able to service this exploding debt is to wildly devalue the currency.  This is the road that the Weimar Republic, Venezuela and so many others have gone down, and it always ends in utter disaster.

Only this time the biggest economy on the entire planet is doing it, and the currency that we are devaluing is the reserve currency of the world.

Sadly, there is no turning back now.  Both political parties are completely committed to this course, and the mainstream media is fully behind them.  In fact, CNN insists that “now is not the time to cut back on the borrowing”.

So when will be the time to cut back on borrowing?

If we need to add trillions to the national debt to deal with a relatively minor crisis like this coronavirus pandemic, what in the world are we going to do when really bad stuff starts happening?

Last November, I was absolutely horrified when our national debt hit the 23 trillion dollar mark.  But by the time this November rolls around, we might be at the 27 or 28 trillion dollar mark.

Unfortunately, we throw the word “trillion” around so much these days that most Americans don’t even realize how much money a trillion dollars actually is.

If you would have been spending a million dollars every single day since Jesus was born, you still would not have spent a trillion dollars by now.

We are talking about an amount of money that is absolutely unimaginable, and we just added that much money to the national debt in less than a month.

Thanks to our free spending politicians and everyone that is supporting them, there is now no future for this country.

We are literally committing national suicide in front of the whole world, but we are so utterly consumed by our addiction that we don’t even realize that we should be deeply ashamed of ourselves."
MICROSOFT BANS HEALTHCARE WORKER FROM SKYPE 24 HOURS AFTER ALEX JONES INTERVIEW. 	"Microsoft-owned Skype has frozen the account of a healthcare worker a day after he appeared on The Alex Jones Show to discuss the coronavirus hysteria and misinformation.

The day after talking with Alex Jones on his Sunday show about the globalists’ coronavirus takeover plan, CT nurse Josiah Dan noticed he’d been locked out of his Microsoft account indefinitely after trying to interview someone on Skype.
“My interviewer sent me a link to connect with the call, I tried to connect and it wouldn’t let me access to my Skype,” Dan told Infowars Tuesday.

“It brought me to the login page, and when I tried to log in it sent me on a wild goose chase to try to find where to fix the problem.”

“When I went to try and fix it, it gave me that message that I violated their terms for use.”

“I still haven’t been able to access Skype,” he continued. “I just tried to do what the website suggested which was to give them my information and then they’d be sending a text message to be able to fix the error, and I haven’t received any text message yet.”

This should terrify everyone.

Microsoft has set a new precedent; they’re now censoring the private correspondence of individuals for the crime of wrongthink."

CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL RECORDS MORE SUICIDES THAN CORONAVIRUS DEATHS DURING LOCKDOWN. 	"California Hospital Records More Suicides Than Coronavirus Deaths During Lockdown
IMAGE CREDITS: SMITH COLLECTION/GADO/GETTY IMAGES.

Doctors at a hospital in California say they have recorded more deaths from suicide than coronavirus, with a year’s worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a 4 week period.

“Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus,” reports ABC 7.

Dr. Mike deBoisblanc, the head of trauma at the hospital, said that he’d never seen suicide at this rate and that the numbers were “unprecedented.” He now says its time to fully end the lockdown.

“I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering,” said Dr. deBoisblanc.

A veteran nurse who has been at the hospital for 33 years also sounded the alarm bell.

“What I have seen recently, I have never seen before,” said Kacey Hansen. “I have never seen so much intentional injury.”

However, the hospital itself gave a statement saying that it was still in full support of the Shelter-in-Place order.

The suicides emphasize the potential scale of the untold impact the lockdown has had on mental health as people are further atomized and ostracized from friends and family."
In Detroit, grief runs deep as city grapples with COVID-19. 	"In Detroit, grief runs deep as city grapples with COVID-19 In this undated photo provided by Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, Michigan State Rep.

Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan’s memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch’s memory after she died from the new coronavirus COVID-19.  Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan's memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch's memory.
That stripped-down scenario has played out hundreds of times in Detroit — 912 to be exact, the number of city residents who have died of COVID-19.
So amid the pandemic, Detroit — the nation's largest black city, the birthplace of distinctive soulful music and black cultural significance — grieves collectively.
Famed across the world as Motown, Detroiters know it as a big city with a small-town feel, with a connectivity that has only magnified the community's pain.
""People always say that Detroit is like a northern country town,"" said Marsha Battle Philpot, a cultural writer known as Marsha Music. ""There tends to be very closely knit familial connections. In Detroit, there's not six degrees of separation — there are only two and, most of the time, just one. Detroit has this character, which in a time like this, exacerbates the grief and the loss. But it will also be part of the recovery because Detroit is a fighting town.""
The virus has disproportionately impacted black Americans across the country, including Detroit, where more than 8,500 infections have been reported, with black people accounting for more than 64% of them. And nearly 77% of the city's residents who have died from coronavirus-related complications have been African American. The losses have shattered the city, compounded by a heightened economic uncertainty.
Among those lost: community pillars, dedicated public servants and Michigan's youngest victim, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert, whose parents, LaVondria and Ebbie Herbert, have served Detroit for decades — as a police officer and a firefighter.
""They've been on the front line and they've served with honor and integrity,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said after Skylar's death. ""They did not deserve to lose their child to this virus. Nobody does.""'
Jamon Jordan, who runs the Black Scroll Network History and Tours company in Detroit, contracted COVID-19 himself, most likely while giving tours in early March.
While he was battling the virus, his mother also fell ill. Despite his mother having existing health conditions, he said they both struggled to convince doctors they needed to be tested and were told not to come to the hospital and instead self-quarantine for two weeks.
Jordan got better; his mother grew sicker. She died March 28.
""She did not make it to two weeks,"" Jordan said. ""She was brought in by ambulance and, within an hour of arriving to the hospital, she had already passed away. I made it, but she didn't.""
And then her family could safely offer only an abbreviated farewell.
""In the African American community, homegoing celebrations, funerals, are just a part of a very spiritual experience that allows family and the community to move this ancestor onto the afterlife,"" said Jordan, a black historian. ""It's a part of a communal practice that goes all the way back to our African roots.
""It's a blow to this culture, our practices, our traditions, that we can't really say goodbye,"" he said. ""When this is over, there are things that will not exist in our community, there are ideas that we will never see come to fruition. Detroit will be different.""
Tributes cascade in every day on a Facebook COVID-19 group memorial page created by Michigan State Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo. Just weeks after she started it, Gay-Dagnogo's own sister became one of hundreds honored on the page.
Julena Gay was Gay-Dagnogo's backbone, everything a sister should be. She died April 14 at the age of 63.
""This type of collective loss, it's profound,"" Gay-Dagnogo said. ""There's a fear of 'am I next?' I started this page because people need to get beyond the thought that black people aren't dying — they're dying in record numbers.""
Beyond the grief lies deep economic pain.
Despite gains in recent years, including the city emerging from bankruptcy, swaths of neighborhoods remain blighted and 33% of Detroit residents live below the poverty line. And city leaders announced this month that the pandemic has created a projected $348 million budget deficit.
A poll shared exclusively with The Associated Press, conducted in early April by the University of Michigan's Detroit Metro Area Communities Study, found 35% of Detroiters employed full time or part time before March 1 have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. The study surveyed 1,020 residents across demographics.
Jeffrey Morenoff, one of the study's faculty research leads and director of the university's Population Studies Center, said roughly 1 in 5 Detroiters say they will run out of money in three months. And research associate Lydia Wileden said the survey also found 49% of black residents are concerned about access to food, water and other supplies and 42% said they wouldn't be able to afford a $400 emergency expense.
For now, the focus is on how to help the city survive the widening ripples of devastating loss.
""There's going to be an aftermath of this, not only physically, socially, spiritually but also, mentally,"" said Bishop Edgar Vann, who has been senior pastor of Detroit's Second Ebenezer Church for 45 years.
""It's going to be difficult whenever you reopen because the norms that we had will be old and shattered. But there is a uniqueness about the city and, of course, one of them is the population being 80% African American. There is a certain spirit here, there's a grit, toughness and resilience.""

Covid-19 situation improving in India: Centre,. 	"Chennai: NEW DELHI: The highest daily surge of 1,975 new novel coronavirus cases in India took the total COVID-19 cases to nearly 27,000 on Sunday but the government said that pandemic situation in the country might be ‘improving’ as several hotspot districts are now turning into non-hotspot districts.
The Centre has however urged states not to lower the guards and cautioned those with high case loads to pay attention on lockdown measures and rigorous containment strategies.The toll due to the contagious infection has now increased to 826 as 47 more deaths were reported since Saturday and 5,913 who were infected with COVID-19, have been discharged or cured of the virus, taking the recovery rate to over 21 per cent.
“People should follow lockdown 2.0 in letter and spirit but it’s a relief to note that the situation is improving as some hot spot districts have now move to non hot-spot category,” said Union health ministry after reviewing the preparedness at AIIMS trauma centre in Delhi--a dedicated COVID-19 hospital.
Earlier, the total number of hotspot districts in India were 170 and but on Friday the Centre had said that there are 12 districts that have not recorded any new coronavirus cases in last 28 days. These districts earlier had reported confirmed cases of the disease.
On Sunday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with the chief secretaries and police heads of all states to review the COVID-19 preparedness response. “He highlighted that states which are having high cases loads should focus on effective implementation of lockdown measures and containment strategy,” said a statement by the government.
It also said, “States also need to focus on medical infrastructure which includes medical facilities such as availability of isolation beds, ICU beds, ventilator.”"
Can Estrogen and Other Sex Hormones Help Men Survive Covid-19? - frnews. 	As the novel coronavirus swept through communities around the world, preying disproportionately on the poor and the vulnerable, one disadvantaged group has demonstrated a remarkable resistance. Women, whether from China, Italy or the U.S., have been less likely to become acutely ill — and far more likely to survive. Which has made doctors wonder: Could hormones produced in greater quantities by women be at work? Now scientists on two coasts, acting quickly on their hunches in an effort to save men’s lives, are testing the hypothesis. The two clinical trials will each dose men with the sex hormones for limited durations. Last week, doctors on Long Island in New York started treating Covid-19 patients with estrogen in an effort to increase their immune systems, and next week, physicians in Los Angeles will start treating male patients with another hormone that is predominantly found in women, progesterone, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can potentially prevent harmful overreactions of the immune system. “There’s a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,” said Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who is the principal investigator for the progesterone study. She said 75 percent of the hospital’s intensive care patients and those on ventilators are men. And pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease. “So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,” Dr. Ghandehari said. Some experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with Covid-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause. The genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial’s principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Anthony Gasparis, with the idea. The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said. “It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,” said Dr. Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York. The gender gap in coronavirus survival became apparent early in the pandemic. Reports from China indicated men were dying at higher rates, but the disparity was attributed to higher smoking rates. But the outcomes were consistent in other countries, with men in Italy dying at higher rates than women, and men in New York City dying at nearly double the rate of women. Scientists who study sex differences say that both biological differences in immunity, as well as behavioral factors are at play. Men smoke more almost everywhere, they say; men also wash their hands less. While women appear to have more robust immune systems, these experts say, the causes are complex and multifactorial, and hormones are only part of the picture. If such sex hormones were the primary protective factor for women, then elderly women with Covid-19 would fare as poorly as elderly men, because women’s reproductive hormones plummet after menopause, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But that’s not the case, she said. “We see this bias across the life course,” Dr. Klein said. “Older men are still disproportionately affected, and that suggests to me it’s got to be something genetic, or something else, that’s not just hormonal.” “Estrogen has immune modulatory properties — don’t get me wrong,” she continued. “You could get a beneficial effect in both men and women. But if women are better at recovery at 93 years old, I doubt it’s hormones.” Research has shown estrogen may have an effect on a protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for example. The coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells as an entry route, and ACE2 is regulated differently in men and women, said Kathryn Sandberg, director of the Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease at Georgetown University. In studies with rats, Dr. Sandberg and her colleagues have shown that estrogen can reduce ACE2 protein expression in their kidneys, so it is possible the hormone may reduce ACE2 expression in men as well. Dr. Nachman said, “We may not understand exactly how estrogen works, but maybe we can see how the patient does,” adding that estrogen played a complex role, both in the early immune response that could help clear a viral infection, as well as in a secondary clean up or repair response, which could evolve into a cytokine storm. “While we see women do get infected, their responses are different,” Dr. Nachman said. “We see fewer of them having the second, disregulated immune response.” The Stony Brook estrogen trial is recruiting 110 patients who come to the hospital’s emergency room with symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia, and who have either tested positive for Covid-19 or are presumed to have the illness, as long as they do not require intubation. The trial is open to adult men as well as to women aged 55 and older, since they have low levels of estrogen. Half of the participants will be given an estradiol patch for one week, while the other half will serve as a control group, and researchers will follow them to see whether estrogen reduces the severity of their disease. The Cedars-Sinai study is smaller, with only 40 subjects, all men, half of whom will be a control group. Only hospital inpatients with mild to moderate disease who have tested positive for Covid-19 can participate. (Patients with certain conditions, like a history of blood clots, are excluded for safety reasons.) The patients will get two shots of progesterone a day for five days. They will be monitored to see if their status is improving, how their needs for oxygen change and whether they go on to require intensive care or mechanical ventilation; their progress will be compared to patients in the control group. The researchers in Los Angeles are pinning their hopes on progesterone rather than estrogen because research has shown that the hormone reduces pro-inflammatory immune cells, and supports those that fight inflammation, Dr. Ghandehari said. The hypothesis is that progesterone will prevent or dampen a harmful overreaction of the immune system, called a cytokine storm, and will reduce the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both hormones are believed to be safe, especially when used for short durations. Participants will be warned of possible side effects that may be a first for many men, like tenderness in the breast and hot flashes. 
Singapore reports 886 COVID-19 cases from foreign workers' dormitories . 	"Singapore reports 886 COVID-19 cases from foreign workers' dormitories.
Coronavirus cases in Singapore crossed the 13,000-mark on Sunday after 931 positive cases, including 886 foreign workers living in packed dormitories, were confirmed. Another 25 were work permit holders living outside the dormitories, said the Health Ministry on Sunday. There were also two imported cases reported today. Both are Singaporeans who have been placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore on Apr 10, said the ministry. Only 13 cases were from the local community, Singapore citizens and permanent residents (foreigners), with another five on work passes (foreigners), said the Ministry. The Sunday's cases raised the total number to 13,624. Twenty-two of the 1,311 cases still in hospital are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Most are stable or their condition is improving, the ministry said. Fifty-eight people were discharged following recovery. In all, 1,060 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. Meanwhile, 11,241 cases are currently isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are cases that have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19, Channel News Asia reported citing the ministry data. Singapore is now in an extended ""circuit breaker"" period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The period was extended to June 1, 2020 from the first set to end on May 4. It will take at least a week of sustained decline in local community cases, which excludes migrant workers, before Singapore can say that it has turned the corner, reported The Straits Times citing experts. The latest numbers on Sunday reined in any optimism that Singapore may be beginning to see some early signs of the infection curve flattening. On Saturday, nine community cases were confirmed, marking the first time numbers have dropped to the single digits this month. Numbers at dormitories also dropped to 597, down from about an average of a thousand daily in the five days before. Experts told The Straits Times that the slide in community cases needs to be sustained until at least the first week of May, and even then, the clusters at dormitories may remain a challenge. Foreign workers' dormitories have been locked down as the government struggles to curb the second wave of the COVID-19. Earlier, reported Channel News Asia cited experts as saying that five weeks from now if the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the community falls to single digits and the situation in the foreign worker dormitories improves, “circuit breaker” measures in Singapore may ease gradually.

FBI RAIDS DETROIT-AREA MEDICAL FACILITY ‘FOR USING INTRAVENOUS VITAMIN C TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS’. 	"The FBI on Thursday raided a Detroit-area medical facility for reportedly treating non-hospitalized coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C, which the FBI appears to be claiming is a “fraudulent treatment.”

Allure Medical Spa, which is owned by Dr. Charles Mok, had been giving out vitamin C injections for free to first responders before the FBI came in and aggressively shut him down. FBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.

On April 18, Allure’s Facebook page had a post that said “At Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.”

That post, as well as a post on Allure Medical’s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down. After talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.

Dr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said “What I’m finding in practice — I treat a lot of COVID patients — is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.”

While it may not be a “cure,” vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.

FOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a “fake treatment” and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing “fraudulent treatments for COVID-19” and allegedly “did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.” FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is “ahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients’] health first, often treating them for free.”

“Vitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,” the doctor said.

“I’ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,” one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.

“The FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,” FOX 2 Detroit reported.

Here’s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:

Allure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees

Allure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. “We are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples’ immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,” says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.

Intravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 – Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS – COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.

If you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19. In addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.

The only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they’re using it to “help those with the virus recover quicker.”

It hasn’t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.

Raiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.

Could this dispute not have been solved with a simple letter or a phone call?"
CALIFORNIA SUSPENDS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO PROTESTS. 	"The California Highway Patrol (CHP) has imposed perhaps the most draconian measure yet as the United States grapples with the COVID-19 outbreak, disallowing groups from peacefully assembling on state grounds after a Monday protest in which Californians defied the state’s “stay-at-home” order.

“Permits are issued to provide safe environments for demonstrators to express their views,” CHP said, according to The Sacramento Bee.

“In this case, the permit for the convoy was issued with the understanding that the protest would be conducted in a manner consistent with the state’s public health guidance.”

“That is not what occurred, and CHP will take this experience into account when considering permits for this or any other group,” the law enforcement entity continued.

On Monday, hundreds of Californian’s swarmed the Capitol complex in Sacramento, causing traffic jams and honking their horns while people gathered to express their objections to being forced to stay in the house. Apparently, such peaceful assembly has been deemed “unsafe” by the California Highway Patrol, and the law enforcement entity has decided to suspend the First Amendment until further notice.

California’s Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom has not publicly commented on the issue.
Many states, notably Michigan, have imposed strict “stay-at-home” orders.

That state banned gatherings of 10 or more people, and barred residents from traveling to visit other residents.

But even Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer did not ban protests of her orders, though she did extend the lockdown after the latest round of angry citizens protested at the State Capitol.

With the nation’s economy collapsing, 22 million unemployed Americans, and experts predicting a recession, many citizens are bucking to reopen the country and get back to work.

Not everyone thinks the country should reopen just yet, though.

Nurses clashed with protestors in a wild scene in Arizona Tuesday, as tempers flared between healthcare workers and those who don’t believe the lockdown is warranted."
GUNSHOT VICTIMS COUNT AS CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN WASHINGTON STATE. 	"Democrat Washington governor Jay Inslee, whose daughter-in-law works for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, oversees a state government that has now admitted to counting gunshot deaths as Coronavirus deaths in official numbers pertaining to the virus, which sparked a draconian lockdown in Inslee’s state.

Freedom Foundation reports: “Today, officials at the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that, as the Freedom Foundation reported on Monday, the state is counting in its COVID-19 death total the deaths of persons who tested positive for the virus but died from other causes.

In remarks made during a telephonic press briefing, DOH officials even acknowledged knowingly including multiple deaths caused by gunshot wounds in the state’s COVID-19 fatality count. The Freedom Foundation’s original report, based on DOH documents and statements provided to the Foundation, concluded that, of the 828 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 8:

681 (82 percent) “list some variation of ‘COVID-19’ in one of the causes of death” on the death certificate;
41 (5 percent) of the death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death, but indicate it was a “significant condition contributing to death.”
106 (13 percent) deaths involved persons who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 but did not have the virus listed anywhere on their death certificate as either causing or contributing to death.
When asked about the Foundation’s report at a press conference Monday, Gov. Jay Inslee dismissed it as “dangerous,” “disgusting” and “malarkey.” He further accused the Freedom Foundation of “fanning these conspiracy claims from the planet Pluto” and not caring about the lives lost to COVID-19. Yet DOH officials largely confirmed the main findings of the Foundation’s report in Thursday’s briefing.

NATIONAL FILE reported:

Democrat Washington governor Jay Inslee is drastically curtailing the freedom of his constituents, prompting national outcry against his authoritarian tactics. Now, records reveal that Inslee’s daughter-in-law Emily Inslee works for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the globalist spending operation of vaccine oligarch and societal lockdown proponent Bill Gates.

Inslee was forced by public outrage to retract his command that restaurants compel all diners to hand over their names and information for contact tracing purposes. Now, restaurants will compile logs of diners who volunteer their information.

Citizens have filed the class-action lawsuit The People vs. Inslee to challenge Inslee’s closure of “nonessential” businesses, and the case has been assigned to federal judge Benjamin Settle.

Citizens celebrated the lawsuit with a rally accusing Inslee of “tyranny” in violation of the Declaration of Independence.

Inslee has spoken alongside Gates, recently signed a bill governing facial recognition software that was praised by Microsoft, and is widely seen as being a Gates surrogate on issues. Governor Jay Inslee’s daughter-in-law Emily Inslee (pictured here in a family photo) works for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Emily married Governor Inslee’s son Joe in 2015. Gates, for his part, recently laughed at the economic devastation caused by the Coronavirus lockdown. Gates clearly missed a progressive lesson on checking his privilege.

“SOCIAL DISTANCING WALLS” – GYM REVEALS FUTURE LAYOUT IN POST-CORONA WORLD. 	"With all 50 states taking the first steps into a post-corona world by reopening crashed economies — Connecticut will join the reopening party by Wednesday — fitness centers will have to restore customer trust with social distancing in mind.

Many gyms, health clubs, and yoga studios are still closed, but the ones that are reopening have adopted strict social distancing rules and new sanitation protocols.

The pandemic has led to wild consumer shifts, essentially transferring the whole workout experience from a retail setting to at-home, forcing some gyms during lockdowns to file for bankruptcy as operators were left struggling to pay rent in their large retail locations.

A major problem with fitness centers has developed, they must restore confidence among customers because, in a post-corona world, at-home workouts, such as Peloton has dominated the scene — and will like continue to be the preferred workout of choice for the remainder of the year, or at least until there’s a proven vaccine. To get a glimpse of how gyms in the US could restore confidence among customers — Twitter handle Ben Lucas tweets a picture of how his gym in Hong Kong has installed social distancing walls around exercise machines.

According to CNBC, who dug deeper into the story, they said the Hong Kong gym is at Pure Fitness in Quarry Bay. A representative of the gym said, “dividers help to stop the spread of the virus when 1.5-meter distance, in line with Hong Kong government’s suggestion, cannot be easily maintained.”

Here’s another view of Pure Fitness’ social distancing walls, this time around treadmills.

Back to the US, the White House Guidelines for Opening Up America indicates that gyms are in the first phase of reopening “can open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.” CNBC says gyms in Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee and Oklahoma, have already opened.

To get a view of how a sneeze travels in an indoor space – watch how a single cough disperses across several supermarket aisles in this simulation. Now just imagine if that was in a gym…Kevin Heffernan, professor of human performance at Syracuse University, said gyms have stacked exercise machines tightly into a close space. “They’re not ideally designed for social distancing,” he said. Gyms have an uphill battle in winning the support of customers — social distancing walls around exercise machines are likely coming to America. At the moment, who in their right mind would step foot into a gym when they can easily take a Peloton class in the comfort of their own home and not worry about COVID-19 carriers…"
TRUMP SLAMS FOX NEWS AFTER CAVUTO’S HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WARNING: ‘LOOKING FOR A NEW OUTLET!’. 	"President Donald Trump on Monday evening blasted the Fox News Channel after host Neil Cavuto warned of possible health dangers associated with taking hydroxychloroquine. Earlier, the president announced that he is taking the anti-malaria drug as a preventative measure against the Chinese coronavirus.

“.@FoxNews is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet!” President Trump tweeted. Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump revealed that he’s been taking a hydroxychloroquine pill daily for roughly a week and a half, along with a dose of zinc. Shortly after the announcement, The Your World with Neil Cavuto anchor called the president’s remarks “stunning” and warned that the drug could kill certain individuals who consume the drug.

Cavuto said:

A number of studies, those certainly vulnerable in the population have one thing to lose, their lives. A VA study showed that among a population of veterans in a hospital receiving this treatment, those with vulnerable conditions, respiratory conditions, heart elements, they died.

Those who took it, in a vulnerable population, including those with respiratory or other conditions, they died. I want to stress again — they died. If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or, in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress that enough. This will kill you."
SANTA ANA POLICE: ROBBERIES SOAR 50% AS SUSPECTS EXPLOIT MASK RECOMMENDATION. 	"Santa Ana, California, is experiencing a surge in crime as suspects exploit a national recommendation to wear masks to prevent the spread of the Chinese coronavirus.

The Santa Ana Police Department told CBS News Los Angeles that the city has seen a 50 percent spike in robberies since California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a sweeping stay-at-home order in March. Speaking to the news outlet, one gas station clerk recounted how he was held up at gunpoint by a masked thief last Friday at 2 a.m.

The clerk said the suspect didn’t arouse suspicion because mask coverings are now the norm, allowing the thief to catch him off guard when he pulled a gun on him and took his cash before getting away in a silver Nissan Altima.

“It’s horrible,” the clerk lamented. “I mean, I know we have to take certain measures because of what’s happening with COVID-19, but it’s the perfect script or manual for a robber — the mask, the sunshade, and a hoodie. You don’t know who’s coming, who’s walking in.” In April, one thief using a bandana to cover his face robbed a doughnut shop on Bristol. The suspect emptied both registers before fleeing the scene.

“It’s the norm,” conceded Corporal Anthony Bertagna. “So we’re seeing more and more suspects wearing the mask and using that to their benefit.”"
WHY DOES THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA SEEM SO DESPERATE TO KEEP THE CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS GOING?. 	"Something doesn’t smell right.

The number of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. each day has been declining, as has the number of deaths.

This is great news, and we should be hoping that the falling numbers are a sign that the pandemic is beginning to subside.

But the mainstream media has been relentlessly pumping out stories that warn of “disaster” if the lockdowns are lifted “too soon”.

According to the mainstream media, by “ignoring science” we are inviting a “second wave” which will be even deadlier than the first one.  And it is certainly true that as we end the lockdowns more people will get exposed to COVID-19, but right now I do not know of a single hospital in the entire country that is currently being overwhelmed by this pandemic.

As long as our hospitals can handle it, there is no reason to continue the lockdowns.

But the mainstream media seems desperate to keep the lockdowns going, and so they keep telling us that we are “inviting disaster” by ending them.  For example, the following comes from a New York Times article that was just published entitled “As States Rush to Reopen, Scientists Fear a Coronavirus Comeback”…

Millions of working people and small-business owners who cannot earn money while sheltering at home are facing economic ruin. So dozens of states, seeking to ease the pain, are coming out of lockdown.

Most have not met even minimal criteria for doing so safely, and some are reopening even as coronavirus cases rise, inviting disaster. The much-feared “second wave” of infection may not wait until fall, many scientists say, and instead may become a storm of wavelets breaking unpredictably across the country.

And this is how that article ended…

Having 50 states and more territories do competing and uncoordinated experiments in reopening is “daring Mother Nature to kill you or someone you love,” Dr. Frieden said. “Mother Nature bats last, and she bats a thousand.”

That sounds quite ominous.

Without a doubt, most Americans certainly do not want to see a loved one die after catching COVID-19.

But of course the truth is that a lot more people are going to get sick and a lot more people are going to die whether we have the lockdowns or not.  The lockdowns can help to “flatten the curve”, but they won’t alter the final numbers from this pandemic by that much.

Initially, we were told that the goal of the lockdowns was to keep our healthcare systems from being overwhelmed, and we should stick to that.

Unfortunately, the mainstream media just won’t turn the hype machine off, and they seem willing to twist facts if that is what is necessary.

Just look at what NBC News is reporting.  According to an article that they just posted, “infection rates are spiking to new highs” in many areas of the nation…

Coronavirus infection rates are spiking to new highs in several metropolitan areas and smaller communities across the country, according to undisclosed data the White House’s pandemic task force is using to track rates of infection, which was obtained by NBC News.

The data contained in a May 7 coronavirus task force report are at odds with the president’s declaration Monday, May 11, 2020, that “all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly.”

No, infection rates are not spiking.  Just go to worldometers.info and check for yourself.

Yes, the numbers are still high, but they are a lot lower than they were.  So it appears that President Trump is correct in this case and NBC News is wrong.

So why is the mainstream media doing this?

Could it be possible that they are trying to hurt President Trump politically?  Without a doubt, Trump’s poll numbers have suffered during the lockdowns, and if the U.S. economy does not bounce back by November it is certainly going to be tough for him to win.

And at this point the mainstream media is not even trying to hide how much they hate Trump.  For many of them, getting rid of Trump is priority number one, and they will exploit any angle that they can to try to make that happen.

But political considerations should not be governing how we approach this crisis.

Sadly, most Americans don’t even realize that if we would have just used basic common sense that we would have never needed lockdowns in the first place.

According to a new study that was just released, none of the lockdowns would have been necessary if at least 80 percent of Americans were willing to wear masks…

For nearly three months, we’ve been urging people to wear masks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, a new study and online simulation tool shows that America could end the lockdowns and beat the coronavirus in a matter of weeks if just 80% of people wore masks in public.

Yes, it’s that simple: Wear a mask and you beat the virus.

Of course at the beginning of this crisis the CDC specifically instructed the American people not to wear masks, and it took them weeks to finally reverse course.

But other nations that used basic common sense have fared so much better than us.  The following comes from Vanity Fair…

The day before yesterday, 21 people died of COVID-19 in Japan. In the United States, 2,129 died. Comparing overall death rates for the two countries offers an even starker point of comparison with total U.S. deaths now at a staggering 76,032 and Japan’s fatalities at 577. Japan’s population is about 38% of the U.S., but even adjusting for population, the Japanese death rate is a mere 2% of America’s.

This comes despite Japan having no lockdown, still-active subways, and many businesses that have remained open—reportedly including karaoke bars, although Japanese citizens and industries are practicing social distancing where they can. Nor have the Japanese broadly embraced contact tracing, a practice by which health authorities identify someone who has been infected and then attempt to identify everyone that person might have interacted with—and potentially infected. So how does Japan do it?

It is actually very simple how the Japanese were able to accomplish this.

Virtually everyone in the entire country is wearing a mask when they go out in public.

Yes, it is just that simple.

In addition, a number of studies have found that mortality rates are much, much lower for those that have a sufficient level of Vitamin D in their systems.  Natural News just posted an article about one of these studies…

It was when the researchers closely looked at data from patients hailing from countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates, namely Italy, Spain and the UK, that they observed a common denominator: they had generally lower levels of vitamin D compared to patients from countries that had significantly lower mortality rates.

In addition, after further examination of the patients’ data, the researchers found a link between low vitamin D levels and “cytokine storms,” a hyper-inflammatory condition caused by an overactive immune system.

Ultimately, we could have avoided so much pain and suffering if everyone had just been willing to wear masks and if everyone had been taking plenty of Vitamin D.

But instead of focusing on these basic common sense solutions, the mainstream media continues to push the fear button, and now Congress is considering a bill which would spend 100 billion dollars “to create an army of contact tracers”…

Illinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush has introduced the H.R. 6666 TRACE Act, which includes a $100 billion grant program which would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create an army of contact tracers operating through healthcare, schools and nonprofit entities, who would perform COVID-19 diagnostic testing “through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.”

Things like this make you want to tear your hair out.

We don’t need an army of “contract tracers”.

All we need is a little bit of common sense.

Sadly, those in positions of power always seem quite eager to take advantage of any crisis that comes along.

We have seen so many examples of tyranny during this pandemic, and this has especially been true in California.  The following comes from an article by Ron Paul…

A Fresno, California waffle restaurant dared to open its doors for business this weekend to the delight of a long line of customers, who waited up to two hours for the “privilege” of willingly spending their money in a business happy to serve them breakfast on Mother’s Day. This freedom of voluntary transaction is the core of what we used to call our free society. But in an America paralyzed by fear – ramped up by a mainstream media that churns out propaganda at a level unparalleled in history – no one is allowed to enjoy themselves.

Thankfully everyone carries a smartphone these days and can record and upload the frequent violations of our Constitutional liberties. In the case of the waffle restaurant, thanks to a cell phone video we saw the police show up in force and try to push through the crowd waiting outside. An elderly man who was next in line to enter was indignant, complaining that he had been waiting two hours to eat at the restaurant and was not about to step aside while the police shut down the place. The police proceeded to violently handcuff and arrest the man, dragging him off while his wife followed sadly behind him to the police car.

We cannot allow them to use this crisis to take away our essential freedoms and liberties.

Yes, more people are going to get sick and more people are going to die before this pandemic is over.

But if we allow our freedoms and liberties to be stripped away in the process, we may find that it will be exceedingly difficult to ever get them back.

Unfortunately, the mainstream media is likely to continue to needlessly exaggerate the threat of COVID-19 for the foreseeable future, and that will almost certainly result in more bad decisions from our policy makers."
FAUCI ABOUT-FACE: ‘PROLONGED’ LOCKDOWNS NOT THE WAY TO GO. 	"After insisting for months that lockdowns were necessary to fight the coronavirus, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Dr. Anthony Fauci now says that “prolonged shutdowns” will damage America if it’s not reopened soon.

Fauci, the institutional face of the coronavirus response and head of the White House coronavirus Task Force, suddenly changed his tune this week about reopening the country despite advocating for shutdowns just days earlier.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said Friday on CNBC. “Now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.”

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that,” Fauci added.

Fauci’s sudden change of heart regarding the lock downs caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during “Tucker Carlson” tonight.

“I don’t mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he’s saying,” Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, “and I think it’s OK to say ‘I really don’t know, guys.'” “But I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or ‘What does one plus one equal?’ you’re going to get seven different answers.”

“I think at this point, you let people — individuals — make decisions for themselves,” he added. “The only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.” Fauci, Big Pharma and the Mainstream Media would have you believe that vaccine injuries are RARE, but when the reports start piling up of all the damage caused by the exact vaccines Fauci has touted, it’s important to start asking how rare they actually are…"
TOP CDC OFFICIAL: ‘WE’LL JUST GET RID OF ALL WHITES IN THE UNITED STATES’ WHO REFUSE VACCINES. 	"A top Center for Disease Control official was caught on tape in 2016 saying that society should “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” to reduce the number of people who refuse vaccines.

Dr. Carol Baker made the alarming remarks during the “Achieving Childhood Vaccine Success in the U.S.” panel discussion sponsored by the National Meningitis Association in New York City on May 9, 2016.

“So I have the solution. Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers,” Baker told the panel. “I’m not talking about…hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms. But refusers. We’ll just get rid of all the whites in the United States…Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most? Immigrants.” Notably, Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in 2009.

The Houston doctor was also honored with the Sabin Vaccine Institute’s 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a Washington D.C. ceremony sponsored “in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Pfizer.”

Is is really that surprising a Bill Gates-connected CDC official openly suggested depopulating whites who don’t cooperate with their mandatory vaccine agenda?"
FRESNO COUNTY SHERIFF WON’T ENFORCE STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS; TOO BUSY RE-ARRESTING FREED CRIMINALS. 	"Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said Tuesday that she would not be able to enforce Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home orders because she was too busy re-arresting accused criminals set free under the state’s new “zero-dollar bail” policy.

Mims appeared on the Trevor Carey Show, discussing the challenges facing law enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the economic hardship. She pointed out that government employees were also vulnerable to the economic damage, because the decline in tax revenues meant that state and local governments would cut services.

Carey asked her: “I’ve heard multiple sheriffs around the nation-state they will not enforce their governors’ shelter-in-place orders. Is that your position?

“That is my position. We do not stop the public to find out what they’re doing when they’re not sheltering in place. We don’t ask those questions, we don’t ask if they’re ‘essential’. We’ve got our hands full trying to re-arrest people that are released due to zero-dollar bail. So we’ve got other things that are on our mind that are more important than stopping normally law-abiding citizens.” "
SAVAGE: ‘I WILL REFUSE TO TAKE’ RUSHED COVID VACCINE, IT WILL BE ‘INEFFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS’. 	"Talk radio titan Michael Savage took a strong stance on the topic of a potential COVID-19 vaccine this week, stating that he would refuse to take such a vaccine if it was rushed into production.

Late Sunday night, Savage tweeted, “Covid vaccine! I will refuse to take it! It will be ineffective and dangerous. There are now 20 known mutations.”

Savage added, “I have never taken a flu shot, and I will refuse to take a COVID VACCINE. If the Govt makes it ‘mandatory’ what will you do?”  The talk radio host expounded on his reasoning in Monday’s edition of The Savage Nation podcast.

“I tweeted something that got me mad, because they’re all talking about a COVID vaccine, and I know, having studied these things, having studied the flu vaccines which are about thirty to forty, maybe forty percent effective… if you look at flu vaccines, not only are they ineffective – thirty-seven percent to fifty percent is what we’re seeing in reports – there are huge side effects to flu vaccines,” Savage said. “So now they’re telling us they’re gonna rush a COVID vaccine when we know there have been twenty to thirty mutations of this virus already, and I’m very, very concerned that they’re rushing out a vaccine that will be dangerous, ineffective, et cetera, so I said this,” Savage said before reading the tweet aloud.

Savage continued, “And if these fascistic, quote, liberal governors think they have a problem on their hands that they’re making believe will go away with the shutdowns, wait until they try to tell you that you must have a vaccine to leave your house. I would join a militia before I took a vaccine. I’d go to the hills, I’m not taking it, I refuse. And I don’t care who tells me I have to take it, if Donald Trump tells me to take it, I’m not taking it, you hear me? I’m not taking it for Jesus, I’m not taking it for Trump, I’m not taking it for Moses, I’m not not taking it for Isaiah, I’m not taking it for Muhammad, I’m not taking it for Charlie Parker, I’m not taking it.”

Savage’s full podcast from Monday can be heard on the May 4 episode of his podcast at around the 37 minute mark."
CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL HAS RECORD NUMBER OF SUICIDES: ‘WE’VE SEEN A YEAR’S WORTH OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS IN FOUR WEEKS’. 	"A California hospital has reported an unsettling number of suicides and suicide attempts, with a year’s worth being recorded in only four weeks during the state’s extremely extensive coronavirus lockdown.

According to a report from ABC 7, a California hospital has recorded more deaths by suicide than from the coronavirus.

Further, medical professionals have experienced a dramatic rise in attempted suicides with a reported twelvefold spike.

Medical professionals at Walnut Creek’s John Muir Medical Center made the stunning claim and have advised for an easing up of lockdown restrictions to protect those afflicted by mental conditions.

Dr. Mike de Boisblanc, who is head of trauma at the medical center, alarmed by the unprecedented jump in attempted suicides, said: “I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.

“We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering.”

“We’ve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,” he added. “I mean we’ve seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.”

The additional volume of attempted suicides has also stretched the hospital’s capability to save more patients.

A trauma nurse signaled that the number of patients with self-inflicted injuries has never been previously witnessed at the hospital.

Despite clashing sentiments, the medical center issued a statement to ABC 7 in their continuance to support lockdown restrictions:

“John Muir Health has been, and continues to be, supportive of the Shelter-in-Place order put in place by Contra Costa County Health Services to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We realize there are a number of opinions on this topic, including within our medical staff, and John Muir Health encourages our physicians and staff to participate constructively in these discussions. We all share a concern for the health of our community whether that is COVID-19, mental health, intentional violence or other issues.

We continue to actively work with our Behavioral Health Center, County Health and community organizations to increase awareness of mental health issues and provide resources to anyone in need. If you are in a crisis and need help immediately, please call 211 or 800-833-2900 or text ‘HOPE’ to 20121 now. We are all in this together, and ask the community to please reach out to anyone who you think might be in need during this challenging time. Thank you.”

California governor Gavin Newsom is gradually easing lockdown restrictions, but the Bay Area appears to be moving at a slower pace, according to National Review. "

People confusing between Corona beer and coronavirus: Google search trends reveal. 	"Out of the two coronas, one might give you a hangover while the other one can possibly kill you, but as it seems, a huge lot of people from across the globe probably don't understand this difference.

There are 22 cases of COVID-19 in Indigenous commu. 	"There are 22 cases of COVID-19 in Indigenous communities in B.C., according to Indigenous Services Canada, but provincial and First Nations health authorities won't say where exactly those cases are.
Keeping the locations of COVID-19 cases undisclosed is a problem, Indigenous leaders say, because it limits what communities can do to trace the illness and protect themselves from further outbreaks.
As it stands, provincial health officials are only naming regions where cases or clusters are, and are keeping specific neighbourhoods and communities under wraps.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says that's to ensure those infected are protected from stigma that could keep them from reporting infection.
But Indigenous leaders like Kim van der Woerd say that lack of communication and specific information makes it difficult for communities to prepare and put medical, security and monetary resources where they are needed.
""If we don't have good data to tell us where the outbreaks are happening, then our communities aren't able to do what they need to do to ensure their safety,"" said van der Woerd, a researcher and instructor at Simon Fraser University.
Pause sweat lodges and pipe ceremonies, restrict contact to stop COVID-19, say Indigenous doctors Van der Woerd says in the past Indigenous people endured outbreaks of other viruses and did everything they could to curtail infection, but lost hundreds of thousands of people.
""Now we have the technology and the ability to get the data and to understand it, where historically we haven't had that,"" she said.

But the First Nations Health Authority, which is responsible for disseminating health information to B.C. First Nations, said it is firm on keeping information about outbreaks in Indigenous communities private.
""I absolutely understand where communities are coming from,"" said Dr Shannon McDonald, the authority's deputy chief medical officer.
""However, there there is still an element of stigma and I know it's attached to fear,"" McDonald said.
'Limited our ability to respond' McDonald said she thinks it's a good idea for Indigenous communities to enact their own emergency measures during the pandemic, but she emphasized that they do not have the ability to penalize people for ignoring a barrier, travel ban or curfew.
Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at UBC, says such limits on enforcing orders speak to a lack of recognition of Indigenous rights.
""We have this colonial system that's been allowed to be there and it has limited our ability to respond in a pandemic,"" said Turpel-Lafond, who recently wrote a paper looking at the implications of limited rights for Indigenous people during a pandemic.
Get the latest news on COVID-19 in B.C. with our daily roundup Chief Slett says, regardless, her community will uphold Heiltsuk laws and leadership.
""We will stand behind our decisions and we will do everything we can to protect our community, under our own laws,"" Slett said.

Fox News Devotes Entire Segment to Mocking COVID-19 Positive CNN Anchors. 	"Fox News’ Laura Ingraham took a break from misleading viewers about all things coronavirus to disparage those at CNN who have shared their experiences while battling the virus.
On Wednesday night, Ingraham, who regularly trolls in dangerous coronavirus advice like touting untested drugs and encouraging people to take part in anti-stay-at-home protests , devoted more than five minutes of her program to talk smack about the newscasters, complete with pre-packaged graphics.
Guest Raymond Arroyo began the segment by panning CNN’s talent — Chris Cuomo, Brooke Baldwin, and Richard Quest — who have, in one way or another, spoken on-air about contracting the virus and its ramifications.
“Laura, the first rule of journalism is: don’t inject yourself into the story,” Arroyo snarked, adding, “But there seems to be a deliberate attempt to graft a slew of CNN anchors onto this COVID crisis.”
“A number of them have contracted the virus and emoted their personal experiences,” Arroyo continued. “It almost appears they’ve launched a series of new reality shows. You could call this one ‘Are You Sicker Than a CNN Anchor?’”
A colorful graphic appeared then on-screen with the name of the faux reality show Arroyo had just suggested, followed by a mash-up of CNN journalists detailing their experiences with the virus.
After the montage, Arroyo put aside the fact that he first presented the segment by chuckling with Ingraham when rolling out the silly reality show name and graphic and said, “Laura, the self-referential emoting is what is so galling. People are dying and losing their livelihoods. Chances are, young and healthy anchors will not succumb to the disease.”
Arroyo continued, “And to keep this narrative going every night that’s so personal, it is disturbing. Because you lose all perspective. It is great to have perspective, but to become the story is a big problem here. And CNN really should tamp down their personal stories. It’s too much.”
Ingraham then chimed in saying she’s “glad [the CNN newscasters] are ok.” But she followed that expression wishing them well with an ironic take that was rather astonishing.
“I don’t really get it,” Ingraham said of the newsworthiness of CNN’s coverage. “Is that the news?” Ingraham asked.
Asking “Is that news?” while in the midst of a five-minute jokey segment on the topic during one the higher-rated, primetime programs on a so-called news channel is rich. If CNN anchors contracting a virus in the middle of a pandemic is not news, why is Ingraham covering it? Like Arroyo just said in this very segment, “People are dying and losing their livelihoods.”
But of course, the two went right back to the comedy portion of the COVID-19 segment by again mocking particular incidents and anchors, which included another prepackaged graphic that made fun of Anderson Cooper."
6 categories of employment lawsuits to expect in the wake of COVID-19 . 	"The coronavirus has upended lives and businesses around the globe. From business interruption and supply chain disruption to event and travel cancellations, we are only just seeing the beginning stages of COVID-19's impact. These articles provide valuable insights on insurance coverage, preparation tips and more to help individuals and businesses reduce exposures as the virus spreads. Slideshow 6 categories of employment lawsuits to expect in the wake of COVID-19 By Emily Payne | April 24, 2020 at 12:00 AM | The original version of this story was published on BenefitsPRO X Your article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided. 6. Disparate impact layoffs claims
For many companies, layoffs and downsizing will be unavoidable in the comping months. What can be avoided, though, is claims of discrimination, if such layoffs are carefully and prudently planned.
”As companies address the need for layoffs and furloughs, the disparate impact of decisions on who is retained and who is terminated will face scrutiny, opening the door to possible claims for age discrimination,” Schmidt writes. 5. Employee medical privacy claims
One of your team members notifies you that they’ve tested positive for COVID-19. What do you do? Do you share this information publicly with the rest of their team so they’re aware of their own exposure? How you handle employees’ medical information will undoubtedly come under careful scrutiny in the coming months.
“Employee privacy claims are likely to follow as the manner in which companies handle sensitive information concerning employees’ medical diagnosis is questioned,” Schmidt writes. “This includes internal as well as external reporting. If employee records, normally maintained on a secured server, are accessed and stored outside of the normal environment, there are risks relating to unauthorized access to private information and resulting privacy claims.” 4. ERISA claims
401(k) plans have taken a major hit across the board, and some people will be wondering if their advisors should have been doing more to protect them against the loss. “Any down market prompts greater scrutiny of past fiduciary decisions,” Writes Schmidt, pointing to the impact that the recent verdict in Retirement Plans Committee of IBM v. Jander, will have. 3. Employee safety and claims
“Companies have been required to balance urgent business needs with employee health and safety during the crisis,” Schmidt writes. “There will likely be class actions relating to exposures to the virus in the workplace. In addition, the stress of the pandemic and resulting mental health needs will increase the likelihood of individual as well as class claims.” 2. Wage & hour claims
With the sudden and unplanned switch to work-from-home arrangements, many companies may not have had time to adequately spell out policies and expectations for employees.
Writes Schmidt: “As a result of employees working remotely, standard operating procedures and controls relating to meal and rest breaks have been disrupted. A lack of adequate recordkeeping and oversight increases the risk of wage and hour claims, including overtime pay. The use of personal equipment for business purposes triggers questions and claims relating to companies’ reimbursement policies.” Advertisement 1. WARN Act claims
The Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires employers with at least 100 full-time workers who are laying off at least 50 workers during a 30-day period (“Plant closing”) to provide at least 60 days’ notice before layoffs. But given the sudden shift in the economy and the mandatory closure or slowdown of businesses, as well as the day-to-day development related to coronavirus, 60 days is more than man employers can spare.
”The announcement of layoffs will likely result in a number of claims relating to compliance with WARN Act and similar state laws, including questions of whether certain exemptions apply,” Schmidt writes.
Transitioning to a work-from-home model. Furloughing and laying off workers . Complying with new regulations from the CARES and Families First Coronavirus Response Acts. Protecting employees’ personal medical information while ensuring the health and safety of the overall workforce.
These are just a few of the legal landmines employers are dealing with these days. The COVID-19 coronavirus and the resulting economic upheaval represent uncharted territory for many employers. As they grapple with balancing concern for employee safety while keeping business running, they’ll be forced to make some unpleasant decisions. Undoubtedly, those decisions will be met with criticism and potential lawsuits.
Recently, the family of a Walmart employee who died from COVID-19 filed a wrongful death suit against the retail giant, alleging the company ignored the man when he reported to his manager that he was feeling ill. Should the company have done more to ensure employees’ safety?
“The fact that there are only a handful of employee claims filed should not be read as indicative of a lack of future claims from employees,” writes Kent Schmidt, a partner at Left Coast Law . “There is a general consensus that there will be many employee class actions.”
Schmidt expects that employment-related lawsuits will align with six broad categories, all of which employers should be aware of and consider as they plan "
CORONA VIRUS IS A BIOLOGICAL WARFARE WEAPON. 	"In an explosive interview Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act has given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it.
Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.
In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped.
He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.
Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked."

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expense as well as certain non-recurring costs that are not representative or indicative of our ongoing operations, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP operating profit (loss) allows for more meaningful comparisons of its operating results from period to period. This non-GAAP financial measure is an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating the Company’s operating results over different periods.
Tufin defines non-GAAP operating profit (loss) as operating profit (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and one-time expenses associated with reorganization in of one of our subsidiaries.
Other companies, including companies in Tufin’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP operating profit (loss) differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of this non-GAAP financial measure for comparison. You should consider this non-GAAP financial measure along with other financial performance measures, including operating profit (loss), and Tufin’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Tufin urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.
Tufin has not provided a reconciliation of this estimated non-GAAP financial measure to its comparable GAAP financial measure because it could not produce the corresponding GAAP financial measure by the date of this press release without unreasonable effort. Tufin believes the information provided is useful to investors for evaluating its operating results over different periods and can be considered together with its historical disclosures of this measure. GAAP results and a detailed reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure will be presented in connection with Tufin’s press release reporting full financial results for the first quarter 2020 scheduled to be released prior to the market open on May 12, 2020.

Latin America moves to mitigate impact of COVID-19 . 	"LatinFinance is making some of its most important coronavirus-related material freely available to all readers. Visit our coronavirus section for all our coverage and to receive the Daily Brief newsletter in your inbox every morning.
Latin American central bankers and regulators have put into action a series of measures aimed at blunting the impact of the coronavirus, COVID-19, as the threat to their citizens and economies grows severe.
These emerging market nations have moved, alongside their developed market peers, to increase local market liquidity, cut interest rates and begin addressing the expected surge in bankruptcies that come as a result of empty restaurants, aircraft and shopping malls, to name just a few of the COVID-19 consequences.
Experimentation with quantitative easing, a first for Latin America, as well as other government fiscal measures to provide cheap loans are just some of the other measures being put into play.

IMF/WORLDBANK/G20
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is publishing research and policy notes under a new section: SPECIAL SERIES ON COVID-19 . It is also providing a special lending tracker , detailing the emergency finances it is providing to combat the pandemic.
Five nations in the LAC (Latin America and Caribbean) region are slated to receive funding from either the IMF or World Bank. Argentina is receiving $35 million via the World Bank; Ecuador is receiving $20 million from the World Bank; Haiti is receiving $20 million from the World Bank; Honduras is receiving $135 million from the IMF; Paraguay is receiving $20 million from the World Bank.
On March 25, the IMF and World Bank requested that Group of 20 nations put on hold the debt payments made by some of the poorest countries, if asked, in order to let them focus resources on fighting the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Taking aim at the International Development Association (IDA) nations , the multi-lateral lenders issued a joint statement saying these countries, which are home to a quarter of the world’s population and two-thirds of the world’s population living in extreme poverty, will need relief.
On April 3, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said some members have asked about ""something that de facto goes into quantitative easing from the world. And it is by allocation of additional SDRs (special drawing rights) to boost liquidity"" in emerging markets. She also admitted that the bank falls short on one particular instrument: ""to provide short term liquidity to countries that are basically strong but may find themselves in a tight place.""
On April 9, Georgieva said the IMF sees trillions of dollars in financing needs to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in emerging markets.
On April 10, World Bank Group President David Malpass said in a LinkedIn post he is confident there will be progress at the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings and the virtual meetings of the IMF/WB for adopting debt relief for poor countries. The plan, unveiled on March 25 calls for big creditor nations to suspend debt payments made by International Development Association (IDA) nations, starting May 1. IDA nations owe $14 billion in 2020 on their official bilateral debt service obligations.
On April 10, Georieva says in a podcast with The Economist magazine that the United States is not interested in expanding the use of Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's official currency unit. Expanding the amount of SDRs would give the IMF more financial firepower to get money to member nations. According to unnamed sources, Reuters reported the Trump Administration actively opposes the extra issuance because it would provide China and Iran with additional resources with now conditions.
On April 13, IMF agreed to immediate debt relief for 25 member countries under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). The initial relief provided for immediate use by these nations is SDR157.1 million, or $213.4 million. This approval (given by the IMF's Executive Board on April 15) allows disbursement of grants from the CCRT for repayment of total debt service falling due to the IMF over the next six months, with potential extensions, up to a maximum of full two years from April 14, 2020, subject to availability of sufficient grant resources. CCRT could grow to $1.4 billion. Haiti is the only country in the LAC region included in this first list. CCRT rules amended in March, allow up to two years of debt service relief. CCRT has $500 million available, including new pledges from Great Britain ($185 million), Japan ($100 million), China (undisclosed), Netherlands (undisclosed).
On April 14, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath unveils economic forecasts for 2020: Latin America and Caribbean region to shrink 5.2% in 2020, rebound with 3.4% growthin 2021. Global economy to contract 3% in 2020, rebound with 5.8% growth in 2021.
On April 14, G7 nation finance officials support temporary debt service relief to poorest nations if joined by China and other G20 nations, Paris Club creditors.
On April 15, G20 finance ministers agree to suspend debt service payments for world's poorest nations through Dec. 31, 2020. Freezing principal and interest expected to provide nations with $20 billion to redirect toward health systems to fight pandemic.
On April 15, Georgieva said fund is making a push to triple concessional financing to $18 billion for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)."

Corona Virus - Why China is becoming a breeding ground for new killer viruses? . 	"Humans are at a great risk of becoming extinct or nearly extinct due to man made reasons like a global nuclear war, global warming and pollution, or global flooding. Humans can also become extinct due to natural disasters like a giant asteroid hitting earth, a mega earth quake, a super volcano eruption.
But there is one threat to humanity that humans should always fear. Not because it may be a threat. But because the threat had become reality in the past, not once, not twice, but many times – even almost wiping out humans sometimes. That threat is the birth of a global killer pandemic. This threat has increased more by the emergence of new strains of killer viruses like SARS, Swine Flue, and the recent Coronavirus.
Pandemics or Mass deaths due to the rise of deadly strains of killer microbes like viruses and bacteria is one of the greatest threats to humanity. A global pandemic might as well cause humans to become extinct if not handled efficiently using proper quarantine measures. Or even better, we should reduce the chances for a new killer strain to be born and spread.
If you are here to quickly read about the recent coronavirus and the reason for its origin in China, skip to the last section of this article . List of past global pandemics An unknown microbe killed around one-thirds to two-thirds of the population of the city-state of Athens in 430 BCE. The Antonine Plague killed around 5 million people in the Romain Empire in the second century. The Bubonic Plague of 6th century wiped out around half of human population. The Black Death of Europe in 14th century killed half of Europe. 95% of Native American Population is thought to have been wiped out due to a pandemic introduced to the continent by Europeans. And not so long ago, in the 20th century, the Spanish Flu killed almost 5% of the then human population in just 2 years between 1918 and 1920.
This is only a small subset of the list of known global pandemics. And there is list of other pandemics caused by Cholera, Malaria, Tuberculosis, Influenza, Leprosy, SARS, HIV, Ebola etc.
And we don’t even know about the global pandemics that might have wiped out huge human populations in the pre-historic era! The Spread of Black Death in Europe Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spread-Of-The-Black-Death.gif Pandemics today are more deadly than past pandemics
A modern pandemic is more deadlier than an ancient pandemic caused by the same virus or bacteria. Why?
In the past it took long time for people to travel from one place to another. Most of the times, due to little people movement outside the infected zone, many pandemics subside over time.
But in this modern era, all it takes is an inter-continental flight travel by one infected person to take the pandemic to a far away continent – which otherwise would have probably never got it.
The ancient pandemics of Europe or Asia listed above never reached the American continent, because nobody went there from Europe or Asia. But today?
Quick spread of pandemics is one of the greatest risks of globalization.
A country can shoot down a nuclear missile launched towards it by an enemy country. But no country can stop the arrival of a new virus from another country, unless of course they completely shut down their borders or ensure complete screening and monitoring of every single person crossing into their borders – be it legal traveller or an illegal immigrant.
According to a simulation by Institute for Disease Modeling , a global pandemic like that of 1918 today could kill around 33 million people in just 6 months! How is a Pandemic Born?
Why do microbes infect people or other animals and birds in the first place? Because most of these microbes require a living cell to multiply. Viruses cannot multiple outside a host cell. So they take over the machinery of host cells to fuel their reproduction.
According to one theory, viruses are thought to have evolved from pieces of DNA or RNA that slipped out of cells of larger organisms. Whatever their origins, being a small piece of genetic material, they can undergo quick mutation, and given the speed with which they replicate – a single virus can try out thousands of new mutations evolving quickly and adapting to changes in its environment.
While complex organisms like humans require generations together to come up with new mutations, good or bad, viruses can do so within few minutes. Human Immune System – The Ultimate Saviour
Our immune system knows most of the viral infections through viral signatures – and it can detect, isolate and kill most viruses and other microbes that try to attack us every day. Much of this knowledge is based on experience of our body – experience as a species, heredity, mother’s milk, and in modern times also from vaccines.
But what about a new straing of virus that takes our immune system completely by surprise? What if our immune system is unable to decide a proper response because it has seen some so far unknown, and at the same time deadly intruder virus. The virus has all chances of winning the war with our immune system.
Even in such case, the human immune system will try all weapons in hand, increase temperature, make it difficult for virus to survive inside the body, even if it means losing a lot of its own cells, create a large killer army of different type of soldier cells – and usually a strong and healthy human body will survive the attack of a new virus. It is the immune compromised, weak, generally old people that find it difficult to survive an attack.
But at the same time, even when a healthy human body recovers, the virus continues to spread – especially if it is airborne – making its spread even faster. An air-borne pandemic is generally the deadliest of all – because it is very easy for it to spread. Thank God, HIV is not air-borne!
We are surrounded by thousands of strains of microbes like virus, bacteria, fungi, many of them live inside us, many of them also are good to us, they help us in things like digestion, and in keeping away other dangerous microbes.
So, from where does the new virus come? Where did the ones like SARS, Corona Virus all come from? Birth of a new Virus – How viruses like Coronavirus are born?
Most viruses and bacteria do not kill their host species. Because if all their hosts die, then the virus or bacteria itself will also become extinct with no host to feed on. So the evolutionary advantage lies in infecting hosts without killing all of them.
So why do new viruses kill humans then? Well, this happens when the virus jumps from one species to another. Take for instance, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. It does not kill the infected cows. But when the same bacteria infects humans – it can be deadly.
The reason is – the immune systems of cows are used to handling tuberculosis bacteria, just like our immune systems can handle viruses causing cold. But when our immune system is confronted with TB bacteria – it is unable to work out an appropriate response. Zoonotic Virus – The evolution of a killer virus
So killer viruses are born when they make a successful jump from one species to another. Swine Flue came from Pigs, HIV from Chimps, Nipah from Bats, Coronavirus from Snakes and so on. Nipah doesn’t kill its natural hosts, the bats, else Nipah virus itself will not surive once all the bats die. But it does kill humans, humans are not its natural hosts, and the signature of it not being a human virus, (it is a bat virus) – makes it difficult for human system to recognize it.
Such virus which comes to humans from another species is called a Zoonotic virus, and that makes it very deadly – because human immune systems cannot recognize it with the pace and efficiency it recognizes and responds to other human viruses.
How does a new Zoonotic virus emerge? The 1918 pandemic is said to have been caused when a bird infected with a strain of bird virus and a human infected with a straing of human virus – met the same pig. Inside this pig, the bird virus and the human virus met and mutated creating a new strain of virus – the H1N1.
So, it was a bird flu virus that learnt how to infect humans from a human flu virus – but could evade human immune system because of its bird flu origins – and went on to kill 5% of humans population in just 2 years. Please note that the seasonal human flu from which it originated was never that deadly to humans. China – Why recent virus outbreaks originate here?
China is famous for its wet markets like the ones in Wuhan, Shanghai, Foshan, Lianghua, etc. Unlike other wet markets where animals arrive dead, in these Chinese wet markets live animals are killed and their meat is sold. This is because customers prefer to see the animals they will be eating to make sure they are healthy.
But this also makes these places a deadly laboratory for viruses to experiment their mutation combinations. The mixing of blood of live animals from different species is a deadly biological lab for the virus strains. And then the new strains make their way to humans easily from here.
It is in one of these markets that the deadly SARS virus was born in 2002. A man in Foshan got sick after preparing a meal of Chicken, Cat and Snake. He was the first case of SARS reported in humans.
And it is in one of these wet markets of China (in Wuhan) that the new strain of Coronavirus – named the Novel coronavirus, evolved in December 2019. Note that Coronavirus is not a new virus – it is a well known family of viruses that is known to cause common cold in humans and different strains of the virus also infect other mammals and birds.
The SARS virus is a specific strain of CoronaVirus that is deadly to humans, and the recent Coronavirus is another new strain that has evolved from a mutation. The latest coronavirus is thought to have come to humans from snakes , the Chinese Cobra – probably from some snake that was killed alive in one of these Chinese wet markets. Not only China
While the Chinese wet markets are a fertile ground for new strains of viruses to emerge, China is not the only place where new viruses emerge from. After all, given proper conditions, a new strain of virus can evolve any where, any time.
The Nipah Virus was first discovered in Australia, later in Malaysia, then it re-emerged much later in Bangladesh and India. HIV and Ebola originated in Africa. MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome was first identified in Saudi Arabia.
The 2011 movie Contagion accurately depicts the birth and spread of a virus causing a global pandemic. The flashback at the end of the movie realistically depicts how a bat virus infects a pig which then goes on to infect a human – and how the virus spreads from there. Watch it if you haven’t. JENNIFER EHLE as Dr. Ally Hextall in the thriller “CONTAGION,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Solutions to control a Pandemic like Coronavirus or SARS
Human co-operation, awareness, proper quarantine and treatment of the infected, hygenic conditions and an efficient administration are the most important aspects of containing a pandemic situation.
As prevention is better than cure, it is better to discourage such wet markets where animals are killed live unless and until proper separation and sanitization is ensured."
MIT Model Shows Connecticut’s COVID-19 Peak is Near. 	"As predicted by tracking algorithms designed by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology team, the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Connecticut is in sight and might be less pronounced than originally feared.
Dr. Ajay Kumar , chief clinical officer at Hartford HealthCare , said the “good news” is that residents’ adherence to state social distancing and stay-at-home guidelines, as well as Hartford HealthCare’s early decision to restrict visitors to its acute care hospitals and nursing homes and to use telehealth for patient visits seems to have worked and “flattened” the peak at a point that is lower than predicted.
“We are anticipating the peak to be April 26 or 27 in Connecticut,” Dr. Kumar told reporters Thursday, adding that the date will fluctuate by a day or two as the virus moves across the state. He believes infections have already peaked, for example, in Fairfield County but may not reach the peak in eastern Connecticut until May 3 or 4.
Hitting the peak, however, does not mean a quick drop in hospitalizations or people needing to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection, Dr. Kumar said. Rather, he said, he anticipates the descent will be drawn out.
“This is a long process.,” he said. “(It won’t be) a sudden drop, more like a plateauing and it will all depend on how we continue social distancing, testing and tracking. For the first week or two after the peak, it will be a plateau with very small decreases (in infection) across the state. “And, there is the risk for it coming back.”
The other positive news Dr. Kumar offered was the fact that there have been 11 people who recovered from COVID-19 and donated what’s called convalescent plasma to help those who are still in critical condition with the disease. Some of the plasma recipients, he reported, have been improving and several have been taken off their ventilators. He did caution that, without more data, the effect of the plasma transfusions is still largely uncertain.
“We need more data and to be more scientific,” he said. “But the early indications seem to be positive.”
"
Asymptomatic Transmission, the Achilles’ Heel of Current Strategies to Control Covid-19. 	Traditional infection-control and public health strategies rely heavily on early detection of disease to contain spread. When Covid-19 burst onto the global scene, public health officials initially deployed interventions that were used to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, including symptom-based case detection and subsequent testing to guide isolation and quarantine. This initial approach was justified by the many similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including high genetic relatedness, transmission primarily through respiratory droplets, and the frequency of lower respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, and shortness of breath) with both infections developing a median of 5 days after exposure. However, despite the deployment of similar control interventions, the trajectories of the two epidemics have veered in dramatically different directions. Within 8 months, SARS was controlled after SARS-CoV-1 had infected approximately 8100 persons in limited geographic areas. Within 5 months, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2.6 million people and continues to spread rapidly around the world. What explains these differences in transmission and spread? A key factor in the transmissibility of Covid-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract, 1 even among presymptomatic patients, which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract. 2 Viral loads with SARS-CoV-1, which are associated with symptom onset, peak a median of 5 days later than viral loads with SARS-CoV-2, which makes symptom-based detection of infection more effective in the case of SARS CoV-1. 3 With influenza, persons with asymptomatic disease generally have lower quantitative viral loads in secretions from the upper respiratory tract than from the lower respiratory tract and a shorter duration of viral shedding than persons with symptoms, 4 which decreases the risk of transmission from paucisymptomatic persons (i.e., those with few symptoms). Arons et al. now report in the Journal an outbreak of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in Washington State where a health care provider who was working while symptomatic tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 on March 1, 2020. 5 Residents of the facility were then offered two facility-wide point-prevalence screenings for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs on March 13 and March 19–20, along with collection of information on symptoms the residents recalled having had over the preceding 14 days. Symptoms were classified into typical (fever, cough, and shortness of breath), atypical, and none. Among 76 residents in the point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) had positive rRT-PCR results, with 27 (56%) essentially asymptomatic, although symptoms subsequently developed in 24 of these residents (within a median of 4 days) and they were reclassified as presymptomatic. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were similarly high in the four symptom groups (residents with typical symptoms, those with atypical symptoms, those who were presymptomatic, and those who remained asymptomatic). It is notable that 17 of 24 specimens (71%) from presymptomatic persons had viable virus by culture 1 to 6 days before the development of symptoms. Finally, the mortality from Covid-19 in this facility was high; of 57 residents who tested positive, 15 (26%) died. An important finding of this report is that more than half the residents of this skilled nursing facility (27 of 48) who had positive tests were asymptomatic at testing. Moreover, live coronavirus clearly sheds at high concentrations from the nasal cavity even before symptom development. Although the investigators were not able to retrospectively elucidate specific person-to-person transmission events and although symptom ascertainment may be unreliable in a group in which more than half the residents had cognitive impairment, these results indicate that asymptomatic persons are playing a major role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom-based screening alone failed to detect a high proportion of infectious cases and was not enough to control transmission in this setting. The high mortality (>25%) argues that we need to change our current approach for skilled nursing facilities in order to protect vulnerable, enclosed populations until other preventive measures, such as a vaccine or chemoprophylaxis, are available. A new approach that expands Covid-19 testing to include asymptomatic persons residing or working in skilled nursing facilities needs to be implemented now. Despite “lockdowns” in these facilities, coronavirus outbreaks continue to spread, with 1 in 10 nursing homes in the United States (>1300 skilled nursing facilities) now reporting cases, with the likelihood of thousands of deaths. 6 Mass testing of the residents in skilled nursing facilities will allow appropriate isolation of infected residents so that they can be cared for and quarantine of exposed residents to minimize the risk of spread. Mass testing in these facilities could also allow cohorting 7 and some resumption of group activities in a nonoutbreak setting. Routine rRT-PCR testing in addition to symptomatic screening of new residents before entry, conservative guidelines for discontinuation of isolation, 7 and periodic retesting of long-term residents, as well as both periodic rRT-PCR screening and surgical masking of all staff, are important concomitant measures. There are approximately 1.3 million Americans currently residing in nursing homes. 8 Although this recommendation for mass testing in skilled nursing facilities could be initially rolled out in geographic areas with high rates of community Covid-19 transmission, an argument can be made to extend this recommendation to all U.S.-based skilled nursing facilities now because case ascertainment is uneven and incomplete and because of the devastating consequences of outbreaks. Immediately enforceable alternatives to mass testing in skilled nursing facilities are few. The public health director of Los Angeles has recommended that families remove their loved ones from nursing homes, 9 a measure that is not feasible for many families. Asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles’ heel of Covid-19 pandemic control through the public health strategies we have currently deployed. Symptom-based screening has utility, but epidemiologic evaluations of Covid-19 outbreaks within skilled nursing facilities such as the one described by Arons et al. strongly demonstrate that our current approaches are inadequate. This recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic persons in skilled nursing facilities should most likely be expanded to other congregate living situations, such as prisons and jails (where outbreaks in the United States, whose incarceration rate is much higher than rates in other countries, are increasing), enclosed mental health facilities, and homeless shelters, and to hospitalized inpatients. Current U.S. testing capability must increase immediately for this strategy to be implemented. Ultimately, the rapid spread of Covid-19 across the United States and the globe, the clear evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic persons, 5 and the eventual need to relax current social distancing practices argue for broadened SARS-CoV-2 testing to include asymptomatic persons in prioritized settings. These factors also support the case for the general public to use face masks 10 when in crowded outdoor or indoor spaces. This unprecedented pandemic calls for unprecedented measures to achieve its ultimate defeat.

Wuhan corona virus does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, Singapore PM says . 	"Singapore’s prime minister said on Friday that the city-state was well prepared to tackle the Wuhan flu virus, adding that it did not appear to be as deadly as the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic. The Southeast Asian city-state, a global travel hub, on Thursday confirmed its first case of the coronavirus strain, which originated in China, and said another case has preliminarily tested positive. Singapore suffered 33 deaths due to SARS, making it one of the worst hit countries outside China. “We are well prepared, because we have been gearing up for such a situation ever since we dealt with SARS in 2003,” Lee Hsien Loong said in an annual Chinese New Year speech. “MOH (Ministry of Health) has now activated plans to counter the spread of the virus, which so far does not appear to be as deadly as SARS was.”

World Bank: Covid-19 could trigger ‘secondary’ global health crisis. 	"World Bank: Covid-19 could trigger ‘secondary’ global health crisis Friday, 24 Apr 2020 08:31 AM MYT Poor women and their families are also likely to suffer from any economic downturn caused by the pandemic. — Reuters pic
PARIS, April 24 — Diverting the scarce healthcare resources of developing countries to the rapidly expanding Covid-19 pandemic could see a 45 per cent jump in child and maternal mortality before the end of the year, an international health consortium warned yesterday.
Unless poorer nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America get a rapid infusion of drugs, medical oxygen, protective equipment and on-the-ground assistance, the global South is likely to see 1.2 million children and 57,000 mothers die over the next six months, according to a study under review by The Lancet Global Health .
The new coronavirus outbreak “could reverse decades of progress,” said Muhammad Ali Pate, global director for health, nutrition and population at the World Bank and director of the Global Financing Facility.
“If routine healthcare is disrupted — as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices in response to the pandemic — the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating,” the authors said in a draft submitted for peer review.
While Europe and North America have felt the brunt of the pandemic, with some two million confirmed cases out of a world total of 2.6 million, lockdowns have slowed its spread on these continents even as the virus picks up pace elsewhere.
In Africa, the week leading to April 21 saw a 43 per cent jump in Covid-19 cases and a 38 per cent increase in the number of Covid-19-related deaths, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported Wednesday.
Economic downturn
Across 45 countries, the continent registered 15,394 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 716 deaths, for a case/fatality ratio of nearly 5 per cent.
“As Covid-19 cases surge worldwide, the survival of pregnant women and children is at great risk due to strained healthcare systems,” commented Stefan Peterson, Unicef’s global chief of health.
The window for strengthening existing facilities — from rural clinics to megacity hospitals — and funnelling material to cushion the pandemic’s impact is measured in weeks and months, experts say.
One key objective must be to “safeguard life-saving routine immunisation programmes” — against measles, mumps, typhoid, diphtheria and a dozen other preventable diseases — “during the Covid-19 response and recovery,” noted Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Poor women and their families are also likely to suffer from any economic downturn caused by the pandemic.
A 1 per cent decrease in per capita GDP roughly correlates to a 0.3 per cent increase in infant mortality, with girls at least twice as likely to be affected, earlier research has shown.
The International Monetary Fund has shaved six percentage points from its January forecast of the global economy’s GDP growth for 2020.
The WHO, meanwhile, said yesterday that the new coronavirus pandemic threatens to severely disrupt access to anti-malaria nets and drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, where 95 per cent of malaria cases occur.
Backed by the World Bank, the Global Financing Facility is a consortium of rich and developing countries, along with major philanthropists, dedicated to helping ensure the health and nutrition of women and children worldwide."
Prevention: taking vitamin C hourly prevents corona virus.. 	" 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia, namely severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) has caused global concern, serious damage, death and emergency. There is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment for SARI. Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and preventing cancer, asthma, the common cold & 69 other serious diseases, like coronavirus. In addtion, 2,000+ studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. --- Dr. Thom Levy We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI. Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic of SARI.
Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Phase Vitamin C infusion , or orally. Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated Supplement: Vit C Drug: Water for infusion Phase 2
Detailed Description: At the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 14, 2020, over 60,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, over 50,000 of whom have recovered, and 1,406 of which have died, and 354 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients, who did not supplement with liquid colloidal minerals or vitamin C, who were overworked, ate too much meat, especially bat soup, ( made from diseased, old bats, who had developed scurvy & the corona virus ),
had been given the flu vaccine, which caused them autism,
who smoked, or patients with other severe underlying diseases like cancer or diabetes. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were CURED, & transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive prevention treatment is still the current main treatment. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties, because it works as a tonic, like white willow bark. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Four mammals: fruit bat, fruit money, humans & guienu pigs, all have a genetic defect that requires them to supplement with essential vitamin C hourly. Vitamins can effectively prevent & shorten the duration of the common cold. Over 60% of the worlds population has a serious shortage of vitamin C, scurvy, and for that reason dies of strokes, heart disease, cancer & 44 more diseases. Society needs to educate people to take 2 grams of vitamin C hourly, to prevent cancer & corona type viruses. In extreme conditions (athletes, parents, students, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent cancer, coronavirus & the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, over 2,000 studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections like corona virus. The recommended dosage for the whole population is 2gm / hr., every day, starting at age 7. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some debatable factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized gold standard controlled trials. "

Teens Pretend To Spill Corona Virus On Subway. 	"The Corona Virus outbreak is serious, which makes it ripe for an idiotic prank. Some in New York dressed up in hazmat suits with gloves and masks, and rode the subway while holding a plastic container with a mysterious liquid inside.
To complete the prank, the container had WARNING stickers on it. The liquid was Kool-Aid, but they didn't tell anyone. When the time was right they spilled it on the floor . . . and after people freaked out they yelled ""It's a prank. It's a prank."" "
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?. 	Someone who has been released from quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading, according to the CDC. 
Four suspicious cases of Corona virus reports negative: MRI. 	Director of the Medical Research Institute Dr Jayaruwan Bandara said that the test reports of four patients admitted to the IDH in Colombo on suspicion of Corona Virus infection, had confirmed negative. Four people including two Chinese nationals were examined at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) on suspicion of being infected by the Corona Virus. The death toll in the outbreak of a new Corona Virus in China has risen to 80 and a number of people infected has risen to 3,000. (DSB) Comments - 2 smd 10:54 AM Fake reports by Gotha. He is trying to get infected people into the country. 
Ferfal, The Corona virus is a human engineered bio.... 	Ferfal, The Corona virus is a human engineered bio-weapon. Period. It has an 83% infection rate and a 15% mortality rate. 150,000 infected, 25,000 are dead. The virus attacks the heart muscle. An undetermined amount of people are literally falling on the ground and dying within 20 seconds. Perfectly fine to dead in 20 seconds. This is an unstoppable Pandemic of unimaginable horror. Starvation, rape, murder, other diseases, will all follow after the epidemic sweeps through an area. People need to prepare today. It will be too late by March 1st. The truth is getting out and the PANIC is coming.
Finally Revealed, Here Is the CORONA VIRUS Medicine. 	"Recently we were treated with various information about the emergence of a very deadly disease. Even in a report saying the effects of the disease caused dozens of people on the streets of Wuhan, China to collapse like the epidemic Zombie Apocalypse.
Yes, the disease was caused by a virus named CORONA! The corona virus was originally thought to come from a favorite meal, pork. But after a statement from scientists it turns out that the virus is from Kampret animals, aka bats.
This virus has actually been around for a long time. Me and my friends used to have even contracted this corona disease. Luckily, we were fine because we had the medicine.
Well, just immediately potion to treat corona virus.
First of all take a glass of water in a clean glass. Make sure the glass is not someone else's former course. Also make sure the glass is indeed washed and does not contain odor.
Next, provide about two or lime seeds. The orange is then halved. When splitting it orange make sure the knife is clean. Then, place it on a clean small plate too. I'm sorry I always remind you cleanliness so that the corona virus is gone, another virus comes home.
After that, take a teaspoon of salt then squeeze the orange over the salt. But first prepare enough ice cubes.
The next step must be careful. And make sure you wear protective clothing first. Then grab the victim's shoulder and tell him to drink water mixed with ice. Continue to tell him to eat oranges mixed with salt.
The usefulness of these protective clothing is because people with corona virus like to vomit. So this is all to keep you from getting vomited.
After that, tell him to sleep and be sure. Tomorrow morning must have recovered. Because this corona virus is a virus because most drink CORONA beer. So for that, find more ways on Google how to treat drunk people. Because corona intoxication is no different from any intoxication.

J&J Makes Emergent BioSolutions Manufacturing Partner for Production of COVID-19 Lead Vaccine Candidate - COVID-19. 	J&J Makes Emergent BioSolutions Manufacturing Partner for Production of COVID-19 Lead Vaccine Candidate By HospiMedica International staff writers Posted on 24 Apr 2020 Image: J&J Makes Emergent BioSolutions Manufacturing Partner for Production of COVID-19 Lead Vaccine Candidate (Photo courtesy of Johnson & Johnson) Johnson & Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) has entered into an agreement with Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) whereby Emergent will deploy its contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to support the manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson’s lead vaccine candidate for COVID-19 that leverages the AdVac and PER.C6 technologies from the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. Under the agreement, Emergent will provide drug substance manufacturing services with its molecule-to-market CDMO offering, supported by investments from Johnson & Johnson beginning in 2020, and will reserve certain large-scale manufacturing capacity to pave the way for commercial manufacturing of Janssen’s adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine beginning in 2021. To support Johnson & Johnson’s goal of supplying one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, a long-term commercial manufacturing agreement is under negotiation for large-scale drug substance manufacturing anticipated to begin in 2021. Large-scale manufacturing of drug substance for Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine candidate will be done at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility, a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) designed for rapid manufacturing of vaccines and treatments in large quantities during public health emergencies. Emergent’s CIADM is a result of a public-private partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Emergent’s Bayview facility has unique capabilities across four independent suites to produce at clinical scale to get candidates rapidly into the clinic, while at the same time scaling up to enable large-scale manufacturing to up to 4000L to prepare for production of commercial volumes to meet customer demand. The CIADM has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on an annual basis, based upon the platform technology being used. Additionally, Emergent had earlier entered into a formal partnership with the US government to expedite development of a plasma-derived therapy for patients with COVID-19. Emergent has received USD 14.5 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the HHS, in support of its COVID-HIG program, one of two hyperimmune development programs announced by Emergent in March. COVID-HIG is a candidate human hyperimmune product being developed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in severe hospitalized patients and high-risk, acute symptomatic patients to prevent progression to severe symptoms. COVID-HIG will be manufactured using plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. “When mission-driven organizations combine talents and capabilities, potential solutions to serious issues like COVID-19 become more within reach to benefit patients. We are proud of our collaboration with Johnson & Johnson and are equally committed to our longstanding relationship with the US government,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions. “At a time like this, we all need to be working together to achieve maximum results for public health. Emergent is committed to our mission – to protect and enhance life – by advancing our own therapies and helping partner companies advance their programs as well.” “We share with our partners the same urgency to combat COVID-19 and will leverage our talents, capabilities, and capacities up to 300 million doses to advance this much-needed vaccine candidate and ensure ongoing commercial supply through our CDMO services,” said Syed T. Husain, senior vice president and CDMO business unit head at Emergent. 
Research suggests presence of strains of corona virus in Kenya. 	Anxiety over coronavirus outbreak remains high mainly due to increased interaction between Kenyans and the Chinese. With two daily non-stop flights between Nairobi and Guangzhou, China, the panic in Kenya may be understandable. But while Kenyans are worried over importation of the virus from China, evidence shows the threat of an outbreak is even bigger from within. Local camels Scientific evidence shows six of the seven known human corona viruses, including the fatal SARS and MERS, have recently been confirmed in Kenya. Corona viruses, local health experts say, present a real danger especially due to climate change and increasing incidence of Kenyans eating illegal and uninspected game meat. In October last year, researchers from Wuhan Institute of Virology, China, and Kenya’s Agriculture Ministry found local camels positive for MERS-CoV and HKU8rCoV. Subscribe Now » “For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of a HKU8rCoV infection in camels,” says the study. Another study by researchers Ying Tao and Suxiang Tong of CDC last year confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in local bats.“Our study demonstrates that the SARS-related CoVs that were identified from Rhinolophus bats in China and Europe were also present in Kenyan Rhinolophus bats,” says the study in the journal Microbiology Resource Announcements . In 2015 a study involving, among others the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Nairobi, researchers reported MERS-CoV in local camels. A year later, the Ministry of Health, ILRI and others in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases reported two people in Garissa and Tana River counties testing positive for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The authors however said the infected people neither showed signs nor felt any illness and had not been a threat to public health.“This is the first time MERS-CoV antibodies have been detected in humans in Africa who had no known connection to the Middle East,” wrote Susan Macmillan, ILRI head of public communications. Circulating widely The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has also confirmed less severe corona virus-related pneumonia among children attending hospitals in Kilifi County.“In this coastal Kenya setting, HCoV-NL63 exhibited low prevalence in hospital paediatric pneumonia admissions,” wrote KEMRI scientists in the study published in 2018 in Journal of Infectious Diseases . In the same year a large study by United States Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya and several other local research institutions, investigated 10,000 nasal passage samples collected from local hospitals. The study confirmed that sub-types of the four less severe corona virus, 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were circulating widely in Kenya. Following the increasing threat of animal disease jumping to humans, in 2011 the ministries of agriculture and health as well as the Kenya Wildlife Services, created the Kenya Zoonotic Disease Unit. But a recent evaluation by Kemri, ILRI and Busia and Bungoma county governments says the initiative “lacks integration between the various sectors, leading to disease under-reporting and inefficiencies.” 
Traders decided to ignore the 2019-nCoV. 	"In our previous analysis we warned traders that markets can very rapidly lose interest in Coronavirus story. Maybe someone could have doubts on Monday, because the bullish movement was mild but yesterday’s rise should leave no room for speculation. Buyers made a serious statement: 2019-nCoV is not going to stop our bullish party.
SP500 bounces from the horizontal support established in January, created a double bottom formation and went north. Additionally, the price broke the upper line of the bearish correction. Technical analysis is pretty clear on this: Brace Yourself, new long-term highs are coming.
DAX was no different. Here we do have a V shape reversal combined with the bounce from the horizontal support and the 23,6% Fibonacci. We can also find a false breakout pattern below the mid-term up trendline. So many positive factors in one place.
Risk ON mode has to naturally affect Gold. Price of gold made a double top formation and broke the mid-term up trendline. XAUUSD is not giving up so easily though. It should not be a surprise as we know that bullion was recently going up along with the stocks. In the long-term, situation on Gold is still extremely positive.

Is suppressing the corona virus infections! - We For News English. 	"China is facing accusations from the world community of suppressing and playing down the coronavirus outbreak and the scale of infections which some reports say now I as high as 90,000 while the official Beijing figure is just 1,975.
International media reports have said cited a nurse treating coronavirus sufferers in China who claims 90,000 people have already been infected.
A nurse wearing a protective suit and face mask treating the sick in Wuhan has claimed that 90,000 people have already been infected by the coronavirus. However, the nurse&apos;s report has been viewed almost two million times on YouTube. In the footage, she warns people not to go outside and to refrain from celebrating the Chinese New Year.
The animal virus epidemic originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,970 people and killed 56, and has spread worldwide.
International critics are saying that the China is censoring the numbers and sanitising videos from the internet. China&apos;s President Xi Jinping has already warned of &apos;grave situation&apos; as killer coronavirus accelerates.
American cities are on high alert as two coronavirus cases are confirmed in Chicago and Washington while 1,000 Americans have been told to evacuate Ground Zero in Wuhan.
Canadian authorities on Saturday confirmed the first case of coronavirus - a man in his 50s from Toronto.
The countries which have reported these cases include Singapore, Malaysaia, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Nepal, France, Canada, the US, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
But the Global Times revealed that vital resources, including masks and goggles, were urgently needed. The accusations of a cover-up echo the furore surrounding the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002 when the government concealed the existence of the illness not just from the outside world but from its own people.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday declared a virus emergency in the city of 7.3 million, extending school cancellations until February 17 and cancelling all official visits to mainland China.
China has quarantined three cities in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus - encompassing a total population of some 35 million people.
Other reports say several cities are under lockdown with a combined population of 47 million including Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Jingzhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Xianning, Huangshi, Dangyang, Enshi, Xiaogan. Jingmen and Shantou.
Reports say that Wuhan continues to be under complete lockdown. Police have been stationed at the borders of Wuhan to block the roads preventing any sort of movement into the quarantined city. The city&apos;s pharmacies have been swamped by people wanting to stock up on medicines."
UP: Prayagraj back on Covid-19 radar as new cases surface. 	"IST Firefighters sensitize the area outside the Allahabad high court during a nationwide lockdown as a preventive.  Less than a week after Prayagraj was declared a "" green zone "", three new novel coronavirus cases — two from Shankargarh and one from Shivkuti — were reported from the district on Friday. Of these patients, two were daily wagers who had returned from Mumbai in Maharashtra three days back and the other was a youth who travelled to Varanasi along with a novel coronavirus patient in a train. The three were admitted to Covid-19 Level One Hospital in Kotwa for treatment. Additional chief medical officer and nodal officer Dr Rishi Sahai said, ""The two labourers were aged about 17 and 20 years and were native to Kapari in Shankargarh. The third patient is a 37-year-old youth from Shankarghat in Shivkuti area.""Sahai said that the two labourers had returned from Mumbai and their swab samples were collected by a team of health department officials on Wednesday. The two tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. ""The two labourers had started for Prayagraj on April 19 to attend the funeral of their father and had been issued e-passes for the purpose,"" the ACMO added. Health department officials are now collecting samples of the two labourers’ family members for testing. Sahai said that youth from Shivkuti had travelled to Varanasi in a train coach along with a Covid-19 patient. When the man tested Covid-19 positive, Varanasi SSP alerted Prayagraj police. Acting on the inputs, a team of health department officials had collected the youth’s swab sample on Thursday and he was diagnosed with the disease on Friday. “Health department has declared Shankarghat and Kapari in Shankargarh as novel coronavirus hotspots. The area around one-kilometre radius of Shankarghat and three-kilometre radius area in Kapari (Shankargarh) has been sealed. Health department teams are going door-to-door to check for suspected cases,” he added. Till last week, nine novel coronavirus cases were reported from districts comprising Prayagraj range — one from Prayagraj, six from Pratapgarh and two from Kaushambi. Of these, seven were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event. The lone Covid-19 patient from Prayagraj was an Indonesian national who had come to the city after attending the Delhi event in March."
A South Texas Native is helping the Coastal Bend and other states in the Country during the COVID-19 pandemic. 	" One South Texas woman is doing her part to make sure healthcare providers have the necessary protective gear to fight the coronavirus.
Benita Suniga says she has made over one thousand face masks by hand.
 200 of those were donated to those who need them most at Driscoll Children's hospital.
Suniga says she was inspired by advice from her late father who she said was known as the Corpus Christi robin hood.
""He always told me when he would be at home always help, doesn't' mater what you have in your pocket, always help."" Said Suniga.
""I just don't believe in charging people in this time of need. we're supposed to stand together and not against each other."" Said Suniga.
Driscoll Children's hospital is not the only facility benefiting from her labor of love.
Sungia has also donated her masks to police officers, fire fighters, and paramedics.
She is currently making mask for veterans in Virginia."
Corona Virus The African connection.. 	"Like every issue of consequence, in our Age of Incomprehension, opinion about the truth concerning the Corona virus outbreak is divided. Either China is taking all prudent steps, the virus, while transmissible, has a low mortality rate and the West, with its travel bans, is over-reacting in a vaguely racist manner, or China has the virus far from contained, we don’t know just how transmissible it is nor its mortality rate because the figures from China can’t be trusted and therefore travel bans are a wise precaution.
If travel bans to and from the infected parts of China turn out to have been justified then one country in particular may be worth watching, Ethiopia. Ethiopia’s Bole International airport is the main African gateway to and from China. On average 1500 passengers per day arrive from China every day. Ethiopia scans them all for symptoms which essentially means taking their temperature.
Many of those passengers then fly on to other parts of Africa where Chinese companies are doing business. These are 2018 figures courtesy of Brookings .
The three main areas of Chinese business in Africa are transport, which generally means building airports and railways, energy which means building power stations and grids and metals which means mines.
One of the airports the Chinese funded and built is Bole International Airport in Ethiopia.
The flights from China arriving at Bole International come from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong Kong. Just yesterday the Chinese government added China’s 5th largest city Guangzhou to its list of locked down quarantined cities. Which strikes me as news. For Guangzhou to have been quarantined means it must already have a large number of cases. Guangzhou is not near to Wuhan, the source of the Corona virus outbreak. It is near to Hong Kong.
It is linked to both by high speed rail and internal air travel. Guangzhou airport is in fact the third busiest in China and the 13th busiest in the world handling over 65 million passengers per year.
So… the spread of the Corona virus in Guangzhou has got so serious that the Chinese government has quarantined it. Yet till now flights from there to Ethiopia were running. Of course I have no idea how many passengers were actually on those flights nor where they might have originated from. But the rail and air links from Wuhan and other cities to Guangzhou and the fact that Guangzhou is therefore the hub to which any workers going to Africa would have passed through, does raise a few questions. Remember, 1500 per day on average (meaning in ‘normal times’ which these are not) through Bole international from China alone.
The Ethiopian authorities have been scanning arrivals. But we know that one of the things which has made this virus difficult to contain is that people can carry it and spread it for up to 14 days before they show symptoms. This is one of the reasons the Chinese authorities, despite draconian measures, have failed to contain it. If the Chinese authorities have failed, how confident should we be the Ethiopian authorities and those in the other countries Chinese workers have travelled on to, will succeed?
I have no idea and frankly neither does any one else. Which is surely the relevant point.
Western Counties have so far contained the virus and I think it likely they will continue to do so, simply because if you catch a virus outbreak early, you can . Viruses multiply and spread roughly according to a sigmoid curve. This plots the number of infections. At the start of an outbreak the curve is shallow simply because the numbers involved are small.
Double from 2 to 4 or 4 to 8 and its not that many new cases. That’s the shallow part of the curve, the beginning of the outbreak. As the curve steepens its not that the virus is increasing its infection rate. The rate will not have changed at all. But the numbers involved grows. Still only doubling, but doubling from 8 to 16 to 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384…you see the problem. Its nothing more than the law of big numbers. That law is what we are seeing in China in the quarantined cities. The question is IF and it still is, thankfully, an IF, some of the Chinese workers have carried the virus to Ethiopia or the African countries they work in, will those countries be able to contain it while they can, while the numbers are small?
I hope so.

Management of adult cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era. Interim guidelines from the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. 	"Management of adult cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era. Interim guidelines from the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Simon Craig, Mya Cubitt, Ashish Jaison, Steven Troupakis, Natalia Hood, Christina Fong, Adnan Bilgrami, Peter Leman, Juan Carlos Acencio-Lane, Guruprasad Nagaraj, John Bonning, Gabriel Blecher, Rob Mitchell, Ellen Burkett, Sally M McCarthy, Peter Alley, Amanda M Rojek, Kim Hansen and Peter A Cameron Med J Aust Abstract
Introduction
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating significant and widespread disruptions in healthcare organisations and societies across the world. Resuscitation poses a risk to healthcare workers, and modifications to our traditional approach needs to change. These guidelines for adult cardiac arrest have been produced by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM), and align with national and international recommendations.
Main recommendations Important considerations include the need to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), recognition that in a setting of low community transmission most cardiac arrests are still not due to COVID-19, and that early defibrillation saves lives. Additionally, as COVID-19 increasingly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered. Early defibrillation saves lives and is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. All other resuscitative procedures are considered aerosol generating and require the use of airborne personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 include a physical barrier such as a towel/mask over the patient’s mouth and nose, appropriate use of PPE, minimising the staff involved in resuscitation, and use of mechanical chest compression devices when available.
Changes in management
The changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all healthcare workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in-situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations. This will ensure safe, timely and effective management of the arrested patient in the COVID-19 era.

“Protecting healthcare providers is the first priority, as you are the primary line of defence for this patient, and upcoming patients.” 1
World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists , 2020
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating significant and widespread disruption s in healthcare organisations and societies across the world. In addition to serious health outcomes, this has also led to social and economic upheaval in many countries, including mass job losses and nationwide shutdowns.
Experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks – notably Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 – suggests that healthcare workers are at considerable risk of acquiring infection, particularly when involved in aerosol-generating critical care procedures. 2-4 This risk is even more pronounced with COVID-19, with daily reports of personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and fatalities of healthcare workers in other countries. 5
In Emergency Departments (EDs), the traditional approach of rushing to a critically ill patient’s side to provide life-saving resuscitation must now be balanced with the risk of acquiring a potentially fatal illness. 6 7 This highlights an ethical tension between the duty to treat and a healthcare worker’s right to protection. 8
In this context, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) has produced guidance for the management of adult cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era. Clinical guidelines on many aspects of the response to COVID-19 have been produced by a team of emergency physicians and College staff working in collaboration with Safer Care Victoria. 9
This paper describes the rationale for changing the approach to cardiac arrest. Our guidelines align with statements and guidance from national and international resuscitation bodies, including the Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation, 10 the New Zealand Resuscitation Council, 11 the United Kingdom Resuscitation Council, 12 13 the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, 14 and the American Heart Association. 15 We have also aligned with other local guidelines on critical care in the context of COVID-19, including the Safe Airway Society 16 and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society. 17
These latter guidelines provide specific advice on airway management and tracheal intubation, therefore ACEM’s guidance does not provide detailed information on this aspect of cardiac arrest management.
Significant changes include an overarching and deliberate emphasis on staff safety, while still providing the best possible care for patients requiring resuscitation. Important considerations include the need to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), recognition that in a setting of low community transmission most cardiac arrests are still not due to COVID-19, and that early defibrillation saves lives. Additionally, as COVID-19 increasingly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered.
Most recommendations in this document are based on low certainty evidence. We have applied standard resuscitation principles, and substantially rely on expert opinion. Similar to other COVID-19 guidelines, as knowledge develops during the pandemic, recommendations may change, and these guidelines will need to be updated. However, at the time of writing, it is believed that these recommendations are safe and appropriate for use in pre-hospital and emergency care systems in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Is resuscitation appropriate?
Ethical consideration of the appropriateness of resuscitation should balance the: Individuals’ goals of care and requests for limitations on measures to prolong life. These should be clarified early for all those admitted to hospital or at risk of requiring hospital admission. This is a shared responsibility of community- and hospital-based clinicians. Likelihood that the patient will benefit from treatment/s Potential for such treatment/s to limit capacity to offer treatment to others with an imperative for fair resource allocation Potential of such treatments to cause harm, including harm to other patients (by diverting staff from attending to other patients who then deteriorate) and staff (through transmission of infection).
A variety of resources are available to assist patients and clinicians in discussions regarding treatment limitations and end of life decisions. ACEM’s broader clinical guidelines include specific recommendations for establishing treatment goals in the context of COVID-19. A summary of this approach is included in Figure 1 ( available in the PDF version ). 9 For patients for whom resuscitation is deemed inappropriate, palliative care pathways should be utilised to ensure appropriate and evidence-based care for dying patients.
Systems to recognise clinical deterioration and prevent cardiorespiratory arrest due to progression of severe illness are also important, within the community, ED and in hospital.
In the event that resuscitation is required, a number of factors should be considered (Figure 2 – available in the PDF version ). These include: Are staff protected by appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)? Are there any documented goals of care / advance care directives? Is there an appropriate resuscitation setting (single or negative pressure room) available that limits risk to others? What is the chance of successful resuscitation with good neurological outcome? What is the risk to other patients in offering resuscitation?
Infection control and aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) in the context of resuscitation
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is primarily transmitted through droplets. Droplet transmission occurs when infectious droplets contact the conjunctiva or mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract or the conjunctiva, either directly transmitted from a cough or sneeze, or by contact with a surface upon which droplets have deposited. The use of droplet and contact PPE (gown / apron, surgical mask, gloves and eye protection) reduces the risk of transmission, as it provides a physical barrier between the droplets and the portal of entry, 18 and is recommended in most settings for prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 19
SARS-CoV-2 may cause airborne transmission if there is generation of aerosols during specific procedures such as intubation and non-invasive ventilation. These aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are hypothesized to result in an infectious aerosol beyond that which would normally be released by coughing, sneezing, or breathing. 20 This aerosol may remain suspended in the air for a period of time, and can be inhaled, leading to healthcare worker infection. Airborne and contact PPE (gown, N95 mask, gloves and eye protection) is recommended for health care workers conducting AGPs in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
During periods where there is sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no significant population immunity (either naturally or vaccine acquired) there will be times when it is reasonable to assume that in the first instance, all undifferentiated critically ill patients are infected with COVID-19.
Table 1 ( available in the PDF version ) provides a summary of recommended PPE for various interventions and procedures associated with resuscitation. Some patients will have been assessed as low-risk for COVID-19 prior to deterioration, and not require droplet precautions for initial resuscitation steps. However, other patients will either be at high-risk for COVID-19, or their risk unable to be determined. In these cases, droplet precautions are recommended for healthcare workers providing the initial response.
Defibrillation is not considered an AGP, with a recent ILCOR systematic review finding no evidence that defibrillation generates aerosols. 21 In general, all other resuscitative procedures are considered AGPs and therefore require airborne PPE. However, these recommendations are based on weak evidence, and further research may lead to changes in advice. We have taken a deliberately conservative approach, in line with various resuscitation organisations. 1 10-12 15 16 19
All staff attending a collapsed patient should be wearing appropriate PPE. The level of PPE dictates which interventions may be safely provided by healthcare workers. A staff member should be specifically assigned to ensure safe PPE use by all staff participating in resuscitation. Specific attention should be paid to mask fit for staff members wearing airborne PPE, and to supervise appropriate donning and doffing.
To further protect staff, it is recommended that senior oversight and expertise is used to minimise the number of people involved in a resuscitation. In-situ simulation may be helpful for ED staff to become familiar with the roles and practical challenges of a smaller resuscitation team.
Optimal setting for resuscitation
It is recognised that cardiac arrests do not always occur in a convenient location. In hospital, a collapse may occur in a waiting room, bathroom, corridor, or a patient cubicle. Traditionally, resuscitation occurs in a large, open ED resuscitation cubicle.
From an infection control perspective, a single negative pressure room is the safest location for aerosol-generating procedures (Figure 3 – available in the PDF version ), and the patient should be moved to one as soon as practicable. However, resuscitation should not be withheld if a single room is not immediately available.
Where there is no capacity to provide any type of single room (negative pressure room, single room with a door, or single room with a curtain) the most senior clinician should consider whether it is appropriate to initiate or continue resuscitation. In particular, they should consider whether the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers and other patients outweighs the possible benefit to the individual patient. In a setting where patients who are positive for COVID-19 are cohorted in an open ward, and all staff are wearing appropriate PPE, this consideration is less relevant.
How should the management of cardiac arrest change?
In view of the above considerations, a number of modifications to existing advanced life support protocols should be made. These will now be discussed, in the context of the “DRSABC” (Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, Circulation) approach. It should be emphasized that all standard resuscitation interventions are still appropriate, however, need to be performed by staff wearing adequate PPE.
Danger
Ideally, all resuscitation should be performed by healthcare workers in PPE suitable for AGPs. However, it is recognised that this may not be the case for first responders.
First responders should be wearing at least a surgical mask, eye protection and gloves. If the patient is high-risk for COVID-19 or unable to be assessed, first responders should be wearing droplet PPE. The patient’s mouth and nose should be covered by an oxygen mask (if available) with flow of up to 10 L/minute. Additional protection against droplet/spray contamination is recommended, and can be achieved by covering the mask with a towel, cloth, surgical mask or clear plastic sheet. 11
Defibrillation is not considered an AGP and can be performed by first responders, as long as the patient’s mouth and nose are covered.
Ensure that any oxygen source is turned off (but oxygen mask and other covering left on patient) prior to defibrillation attempts.
Chest compressions, assisted ventilation, and advanced airway manoeuvres are all considered potentially AGPs, and should only be performed by responders in airborne PPE and in an appropriate space. It is reasonable for compression-only CPR to commence outside and en route to a single room (i.e. in a corridor, waiting room, etc), provided that responders are wearing airborne PPE, and the patient’s mouth and nose are covered as outlined above.
Response and Send for help
If the patient is unresponsive and not breathing normally, then resuscitation may be necessary. Call for help. Ensure that all clinicians are wearing appropriate PPE.
Airway and Breathing
Listening or feeling for breathing should not occur. Instead, place a hand on patient’s chest to feel for chest rise and fall while assessing for normal breathing.
Place a standard oxygen mask (e.g. Hudson mask) on the patient and open their airway with a head tilt / chin lift. Do not attempt to clear the airway using any other methods. Suctioning of the orophanynx should not occur through an open suction device (i.e. Yankauer sucker) until in an appropriate location with staff using airborne PPE.
Provide passive oxygen at a flow rate of 10 L/minute.
Do not provide positive pressure ventilation until in an appropriate physical location and wearing airborne PPE. An appropriate heat and moisture exchanging (HME) viral filter must be connected to any positive pressure oxygen delivery device, as close to the patient as possible. Consider adding a closed in-line suction system (Figure 3 – available in the PDF version ). Take care to ensure that all connections are secure and consider the use of reinforcing tape.
Bag-mask ventilation should be minimised. If required, use two hands to hold the mask. Compressions should be paused, and the bag should be squeezed by a second rescuer at a compression:ventilation ratio of 30:2. 21 A supraglottic airway device is preferred to a face mask, as it is thought to reduce the risk of aerosols. 16
Pause compressions before inserting a supraglottic airway or attempting to intubate.
If additional oxygen delivery is required, a well-fitted supraglottic airway device (e.g. an i-gel) should be inserted and connected via an appropriate filter to a Mapleson circuit (“anaesthetic bag”) or a standard self-inflating bag.
A Mapleson circuit is preferred due to the ability to provide passive oxygen flow without the need to provide positive pressure ventilation. If using a Mapleson circuit, connect the circuit to oxygen, but do not squeeze the bag.
If using a standard self-inflating bag, monitor the movement of the reservoir bag. If oxygen is being delivered, then do not squeeze the bag. However, in the absence of respiratory effort, oxygen may not be delivered due to the valve mechanism of a standard self-inflating bag, and gentle squeezing of the bag may be required.
If possible, positive pressure ventilation should only be delivered once an endotracheal tube has been inserted in the trachea, the cuff has been inflated, an HME viral filter connected, and correct placement confirmed.
Suctioning through an endotracheal tube should occur through a closed inline system, in the highest level of isolation available, and by a healthcare worker in airborne PPE.
Circulation
Rapid rhythm assessment and defibrillation should be prioritised.
Until endotracheal intubation has occurred, compression-only CPR is recommended. However, if positive pressure ventilation is required, then compressions should be paused to allow ventilation while using a mask or supraglottic airway. 12
Mechanical CPR devices should be used when available and staff are adequately trained in their use. They may be useful to reduce the number of healthcare workers present during resuscitation.
Modified resuscitation algorithm
An algorithm for adult advanced life support is presented (Figure 4 – available in the PDF version ). This is an adaptation of the New Zealand Resuscitation Council algorithm, with modification of the terminology for PPE. An approach to the initial steps of resuscitation is presented in Figure 5 ( available in the PDF version ).
Monitoring of resuscitation
Apart from minimising the number of people in the room, resuscitation should occur according to established protocols. Waveform capnography should be used. Focused cardiac ultrasound may be useful to guide resuscitation efforts, and / or demonstrate absence of cardiac activity and early cessation of resuscitation.
Advanced resuscitation techniques
Advanced resuscitation techniques such as extracorporeal life support should be carefully considered and only used in exceptional circumstances for currently accepted indications (e.g. massive pulmonary embolism, or specific toxicologic emergencies). Provision of such interventions should include assessment of the potential benefit to the patient, resources required, and the potential associated diversion of resources from others for delivery of such treatments.
In the setting of a cardiac arrest in the ED from presumed COVID-19, escalation to extracorporeal life support is not currently recommended, due to a high likelihood of futility.
Post-resuscitation care
If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved prior to intubation, then time should be taken to assess need for and potential benefit of intubation in the context of the individual’s goals of care.
If requiring mechanical ventilation, clamp the endotracheal tube before disconnecting from the patient. Ensure a closed inline suction system is connected.
At the end of resuscitation attempts, everyone should remove PPE carefully, and thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser). It is recommended that staff observe each other while removing PPE to monitor for possible breaches in infection control procedures.
Equipment should be cleaned, disinfected or disposed of according to hospital protocols.
Following resuscitation, it is important to conduct a debrief with team members, to specifically address clinical care and decision-making, communication, PPE and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Additional support may be required due to the risk to staff, altered decision-making framework, lack of physical proximity of the patient’s family members and significant mortality rate of COVID-19. Any breaches of PPE policy should be documented and reported and followed up according to local protocols.
A log of all staff attending the resuscitation should be maintained to facilitate appropriate infection control follow-up if needed.
Termination of resuscitation
Cardiac arrests will still occur due to all of the “usual” causes such as acute coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, anaphylaxis, drug toxicity, and neurological events. Decisions regarding resuscitation termination should be made according to currently accepted standards.
A cardiac arrest in a patient with COVID-19 infection and respiratory failure should prompt rapid assessment and treatment of potentially reversible causes. If no such cause is identified, clinicians should give early consideration to futility of ongoing resuscitation. 22
Care for family members
During the COVID-19 pandemic, family members are likely to be restricted from entering resuscitation rooms, apart from in exceptional circumstances (for example paediatric cardiac arrest). If resuscitation is unsuccessful, family members may – according to local hospital policies and infection control measures - be allowed to view the body. However, restrictions in place due to COVID-19 may significantly disrupt usual grieving processes – for example, not being allowed to touch or kiss the deceased. 23 If required, social work support should be provided to family members in a safe location or via telehealth where COVID-19 precludes visitation. Bereavement procedures can otherwise follow local hospital guidelines. Appropriate PPE should be used by staff when preparing the body for the mortuary.
Training and simulation
The changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all healthcare workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in-situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations. This will ensure safe, timely and effective management of the arrested patient in the COVID-19 era.
Conclusion
Although infection risks posed by COVID-19 influence all aspects of adult cardiac arrest management, the basic principles of resuscitation remain the same. Modifications to traditional approaches include a much greater emphasis on safety of healthcare workers and use of adequate personal protective equipment. However, prioritisation of rapid defibrillation and attention to reversible causes of cardiac arrest remain critical interventions to improve patient outcomes.

No new COVID-19 infections recorded in Hong Kong for the second time this week Hong Kong. 	"For the second time this week , Hong Kong has no new COVID-19 infections to report.
We are trying desperately not to get our hopes up, but… this is good news! Especially considering that the last confirmed case we heard about was a Covidiot who spent three weeks running around town with symptoms .
Currently, the total number of cases is sitting at 1036, comprising 1035 confirmed cases and one probable case.
The Center said in a press release that people should continue to stay in more, avoid social activities, and practice good hygiene in order to reduce the risk of outbreak clusters.
A spokesman for the CHP said that the COVID-19 situation “remains severe” and urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel, given the “continuous increase in the number of cases reported around the world”.
Today is the 12th consecutive day that the number of new coronavirus cases in Hong Kong has been in the single digits or below. On Monday, the city recorded zero new infections for the first time since March 5.
Health officials have repeatedly stressed that citizens should not let the lower number of new infections lull them into a false sense of security, and urged people to continue complying by government restrictions and staying hygienic.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam echoed the sentiment and said the city would have to continue observing social distancing regulations for at least two more weeks .

Covid-19 test to start at GDMC from today. 	"The testing of samples for COVID-19 would start at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) from Saturday. On Friday the microbiology lab of the medical college was given formal approval by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to start testing for COVID-19. The Principal of the GDMC, Dr Ashutosh Sayana said that the speed of testing of the samples in the state would increase with the GDMC lab becoming operational for COVID-19 tests. He said that the lab is ready and the training to the staff has been given for testing of swab samples of suspected patients. The Principal said that the college would receive the test kits by Friday evening. He added that six microbiologists of GDMC would conduct the tests.
After start of COVID-19 tests at GDMC, the state would have three centres of test of samples for the disease in government sector. A private lab ( Aahuja lab) in Dehradun has also been authorised to conduct COVID-19 tests.
At present the testing facilities of COVID-19 are available only at the laboratory of department of microbiology of Government Medical College, Haldwani and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh. Till last month Lab of Haldwani was the only facility in the state for COVID-19. On March 31, the AIIMS Rishikesh also started doing the tests.
The confirmatory test of the COVID-19 involves detection of Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA) of the virus by the Real Time (RT) -PCR method. "
Chittoor man fears corona virus, commits suicide. 	"A person suspecting infliction of the dreaded Corona virus committed suicide in Seshamanaidu Kandriga of Thottambedu Mandal in Chittoor district on Monday. It came to light Tuesday morning.
According to sources, Balakrishna, 50, from the village, has been ailing with reported hypertension and increased pulse rate and he visited Ruia Hospital, Tirupati for treatment.
Doctors informed him about some virus infection and prescribed some medication. He reportedly spent two days there and returned to his village. Due to a lack of knowledge of the virus and apprehensions on the Corona virus, he started behaving typically soon after reaching the home on Sunday.
He kept himself aloof from others saying he had been infected with the dangerous virus and asked his family members to be away from him. He even pelted stones on some of his family members and locked his room. Family members reportedly informed the officials on the situation and sought their help.
On Monday morning, Balakrishna left for the fields where his mother was buried and hanged himself to a nearby tree. Farmers, who work in the nearby fields, noticed it and informed to the family members.
District Medical and Health Officer Dr M Penchalaiah said that they had come to know about the incident and deputed a doctor to visit the house of the person to ascertain medical facts. He would reveal the details after collecting information from the family members.

Opinion: Canada must protect itself from America’s response to COVID-19. 	President Trump will want the border to reopen too soon. Canadians can’t let that happen. Many beaches in Florida reopened last weekend, as if they existed on a planet not infected with a novel coronavirus. On April 14, the state reported its worst day yet – 72 new COVID-19 deaths. Yet three days later, Governor Ron DeSantis would give the go-ahead to slowly resume normal activities. Live shots of Floridians congregating on beaches that afternoon were like frozen CCTV clips of the seconds before a traffic collision. It’s a bizarre thing to watch unfold from Canada, where even provinces and territories with flat or receding tallies of COVID-19 cases have yet to relax their physical distancing measures. The U.S., which is rapidly approaching one million active infections, is seeing some state governments already moving in the other direction.
Unnecessary Panic Over the “Corona” Virus. 	"I wanted to address the media’s fear mongering and panic with the new “corona virus,” and China’s overdoing it with the closing down of whole cities out of hysteria and panic. But I spent more time on my previous post than I had planned. So I will make this more brief.
Over the past several years I have come to see just how the mainstream news media have become mostly repeaters of official government press releases. It’s mainly propaganda, as we have seen and continue to see with the coverage of the 2016 election-Russia investigation and this impeachment farce. The media are the same with medical issues, in their being spokespeople for the pharmaceutical companies.
So, I really want to link to Jon Rappoport’s two recent posts that address these issues, on the latest virus, the “corona” virus. Those two posts are: China virus epidemic – the Gong Show on roller skates , and on the man who mushed the SARS dud now pushing new Chinese virus . Very good information and insight, in my opinion.
He makes reference to how in the past such as with SARS the media would not disclose that many cases of “SARS” were really patients with flu-like symptoms but who did not test positive for the “SARS” virus.
Rappoport brings up how medical and government officials don’t seem to want to look at an area’s sanitation and water systems, which are very important in these issues. There are also areas of malnutrition, in which a common problem is the compromised immune systems of many in the population, in which toxic vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs are killing them.
But, “THE VIRUS” is what needs to be obsessed with. In these “epidemics,” many of those suffering don’t actually test positive for the virus in question. They have flu-like symptoms. And one reason some of the people with the sicknesses actually die — and I did hear a newscaster mention this, I couldn’t believe a little truth was told — is because those people already had other serious medical conditions.
So, people with medical conditions should be as well-nourished as possible, for prevention.
But in China, a country with an ultra-authoritarian government that already keeps the masses in fear of the regime with the “social credit score,” etc., the government is closing down whole cities? Those rulers are even worse control freaks than the power-addicted people in Washington."

Death of Dr Frank Plummer and the Bio-weapon Corona Virus. 	"Frank Plummer, 67, died in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday 4 Feb 2020, where he was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Manitoba/Kenya research collaboration. The BBC reports that he died of a heart attack. G5 wrote in an email to me saying “Plummer was neutralized. As have been others not recorded. His alcoholism and the culture of the Winnipeg Lab are not true.”
by G5
I refer you back to a recent piece I wrote concerning Corona being linked to other US manufactured Bio-Weapons such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, HIV-AIDS, Lyme. And that’s apart from the development of LSD, Crack Cocaine etc. And apart from the S40 contaminated Sabine Vaccine after the Salk Vaccine etc.
The initial development of all these weapons occurred in US labs as Fort Detrick. From there they went to government labs in Harvard University, Johns Hopkins, Big Pharma Usual Suspects, and various labs in Canada. The Rockefellers originally funded Canada, together with hidden government funds from Canada, the US, and the UK. France and the Netherlands were also connected.
On 18 October 2019, ‘Event 201’ was staged in New York City. An international conference funded by the Gates Foundation and involving Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security [sic], and The World Economic Forum. It was determined that a world pandemic would initially kill some 65 million. Johns Hopkins had been experimenting on pigs and extrapolating that data.
Frank Plummer was funded additionally by one recorded transfer of CAD 8.3 million from the Gates Foundation. They would know what is happening in those facilities.
Corona was in vaccinations with HIV, packaged as a vaccine, sent from US facilities. Plummer was contacted and sent a sample of Corona from [a patient in] Saudi Arabia isolated on 4 May 2013.
The Wuhan Corona Samples were initially taken to a facility in Rotterdam in 2019 — where they were identified.
Saudi Arabia is meant to have used this weapon in the Middle East and African states in which they have been conducting genocides in the form of religious cleansing. The Winnipeg Facility experiments included those concerning Ebola and Uracine.
Geoff Soule also disappeared from the NML (National Biological Laboratory) at Winnipeg.
Frank Plummer was taken out in Nairobi on 4 February 2020. He had been working as head of the Winnipeg Microbiology research laboratory since its inception in 1999, until he was removed in 2014.
One of his researches was Deep Cover Chinese Intel operative Xiangguo Qiu. She was removed in July 2019. And subsequently disappeared. In March 2019 she sent courier carried samples of Ebola, Henipah, and Corona to a government laboratory in Wuhan — where it was further weaponized and ‘accidentally’ released.
DARPA is involved with Corona.
Dr. Francis Boyle (hidden on the net) was a researcher. He fled and has disappeared. He was a US government microbiologist and exposed the ‘development of lethal, genetically engineered bio-weaponry, as part of an ongoing agenda, initiated and pushed through US military intelligence, with Big Pharma, and military intelligence in many countries.
FVEY [Five Eyes] Australia is involved. Boyle advised that many vaccines — contrary to claims — have been developed and laced with Corona virus. As with that for HIV. Plummer had experimented with SARS-Corona and HIV-Corona.
All samples are held by ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) where the stolen UN WHO Smallpox stocks (about which I have written ) were taken.
ATCC is the world’s prime biological culture repository. From there samples are sent to the four designations of BSL (Biosafety Level) laboratories. From BSL-1 housing and experimenting with for example e-coli, to BSL-4 researching (experimenting) with Corona etc.
Gates and Globalist Entities, together with the usual suspect governments, fund The BSL-4 laboratories. Wuhan is one. Established to develop Lethal, Offensive Bioweapons, and block identification, management, and vaccine development — as Bolivian Hemorrhagic, Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Crimean–Congo, Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) etc. (Don Rickles was removed by an NF.)
There are 13 BSL-4 facilities in the US (i.e., Bio-Weapons Laboratories), and this is apart from the Chemical Weapons Laboratories, and the Atomic and Radiation Laboratories and arsenals.
Wuhan, as Saudi Arabia and Florida, as I previously wrote, are predominantly accidents. Anthrax in the GWB-Cheney era was a False Flag.
Kosovo, Kurdistan, Ghouta, Khan Sheikhoun etc., are US Genocidal War Crimes — as was The Oil for Food Program."

5 fresh Covid-19 cases in Haryana, total count 275. 	"Five fresh Covid-19 cases were reported from Gurgaon, Panipat and Rohtak as the number of coronavirus patients rose to 275 in Haryana on Friday. The positive cases in the state include 24 foreigners, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. While Gurgaon reported two cases, taking the number of Covid-19 patients to 47 in the district, Panipat also reported two cases and Rohtak one. According to the bulletin, the number of active coronavirus cases in the state stands at 86, while 186 patients have been discharged and three have died.
As on Friday, the state has a recovery rate of 67.63 per cent, fatality rate of 1.09 per cent and Covid-19 positive rate of 1.62 per cent (proportion of positive cases to total tests conducted), according to the bulletin.
The rate of doubling of cases is 17 days in the state, while the number of tests being conducted per 10 lakh people is 743, it said. The worst-hit districts of the state are Nuh (57 cases), Gurgaon (47), Faridabad (43) and Palwal (34). As many as 18,445 samples have been tested in Haryana so far, of which 16,642 have tested negative, while the report of 1,928 samples is awaited. Of the 24 foreign nationals who tested positive, 14 were Italian tourists, 13 of whom have been discharged, while one elderly woman passed away recently, even though she had recovered from Covid-19. Of the total number of Covid-19 patients, 64 are from other states, according to the bulletin. "
Single-cell RNA expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCov. 	Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCov Yu Zhao, Zixian Zhao, Yujia Wang, Yueqing Zhou, Yu Ma, Wei Zuo A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development. We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.

M-m-m-my corona scare. 	"For something different (note sarcasm) I am writing about the coronavirus, which currently is taking up about 50 per cent of our media reports each day.
So I guess my little contribution won’t make much difference.
The thing is I find it hard to understand what is fact and what is fake news.
It is pretty hard to decipher – a bit like climate change.
We do know it’s there but depending on what reports you read, hear and from what angle, it is hard to figure how bad it is.
Now before I go any further I am not making light of what is happening worldwide with this virus.
But I am going to make a little light of what happened to me last week.
Before I do that, I do want to share something serious with you.
I was in Denpasar Airport the other day on my way back from Bali and I was doing my usual people watching when I saw something I wished I hadn’t.
I was sitting at a bar waiting for my plane and there was a flight to Kuala Lumpur boarding opposite me.
Now at least half the people in the airport had masks on.
As I sat there about half a dozen Aussies in a group walked past, pulled their shirts over their heads and basically abused the Asians getting on the plane about the virus.
I couldn’t believe it. It was awful.
Which brings me to a slightly lighter note.
While I was sitting there, old mate texts me from home answering a comment I sent to her about half the airport having masks on, asking “Well, where’s yours?”
“Don’t make them for heads like mine,” I replied.
She says, “Not funny.”
That was the end of the banter.
I boarded my plane and had a really nice relaxing flight home where I contemplated that fact that for the past 18 months and a dozen trips to Bali, this was the first one that I never had one sick day.
Awesome, I thought, as I snoozed homeward bound.
Arrived back in the hood about midnight and woke the next morning feeling a bit odd.
Went to get up and had vertigo followed by projectile vomiting, which was distinctly green in colour and I started sweating bullets on a morning where it was about 20C.
My dear other half who had just kissed me had a look of “get the hell away from me, I told you to wear a mask”.
So I adjourned to the driveway with my plastic bucket. After it just continued to get worse I rang the ambulance stating, “Look this is probably a false alarm but I have just come back from Bali and have blah blah blah”.
The paramedics arrived shortly after following the proper procedures and took me off to Sunshine Coast University Hospital where I was poked, prodded and measured by the unlucky crew that picked me up.
The medical team ruled out coronavirus but over a period of a couple of hours I reckon I did a pretty good impression of a harp seal echoing the corridors of the hospital with some pretty wild sounds.
I spent the day there feeling much better after treatment and some wonderful care.
It just reminded me, on a few fronts, how wonderful our medical and emergency staff are.
We are so lucky and no matter what happens with the coronavirus we need to all remain compassionate human beings.
Thank you, Queensland Health."
Corona virus outbreak prevents divers from going to Truk. 	"We've have been informed by a reader that dive travellers heading out to Truk Lagoon, at least when transiting through the Philippines, will now be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine period in Guam due to the presence of corona virus in the Philippines.
A group of divers who were stopped in Manila ended up opting for going diving somewhere in the Philippines instead.
At this moment, we don't have any official information but are investigating.
Meanwhile, I would be prudent for dive travellers, who are about to head out to the region, to check with their travel agency, foreign ministry/state department or embassy of the relevant country or countries. Also be mindful that information and precautionary measures may change on very short notice.

FDA Grants ALung Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System (RAS) for the Treatment of COVID-19. 	"ALung Technologies, Inc., the leading provider of low-flow extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R) technologies for treating patients with acute respiratory failure, announced that the has granted the Company Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) designation to the Hemolung® Respiratory Assist System (RAS) for the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. ALung has treated numerous COVID-19 patients in the U.S. under existing FDA Emergency Use Provisions, and in the European Union, where the Company is approved having been granted their CE Mark in 2013. The Hemolung® RAS is currently being used in the FDA approved VENT-AVOID trial for the study of ECCO 2 R in the treatment of Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AE-COPD). In addition, the Hemolung RAS and ECCO 2 R have been studied for the treatment of moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the just concluded UK REST trial, which enrolled 412 patients.
A public health emergency related to COVID-19 was declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on February 4, 2020. The FDA has issued an EUA for the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19. As indicated in the FDA's EUA letter to ALung, the Hemolung RAS is not FDA-cleared or approved, and there are no FDA-approved or cleared device treatments for lung failure caused by COVID-19. ALung submitted and the FDA reviewed in vitro and in vivo information in support of ALung's ongoing U.S. VENT-AVOID clinical trial for the Hemolung RAS as well as additional information about clinical use of the Hemolung RAS outside the U.S., and additional biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and performance testing.
Based on the information submitted, the FDA stated that it believes the Hemolung RAS has the potential to treat lung failure as an adjunct to noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, to reduce hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis due to COVID-19, and/or to maintain normalized levels of partial pressure of carbon dioxide(PCO 2 ) and pH in patients suffering from acute, reversible respiratory failure due to COVID-19 for whom ventilation of CO 2 cannot be adequately, safely, or tolerably achieved and, in turn, may provide clinical benefit, and that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the emergency use of the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19.
""We are pleased with the FDA's recognition that the Hemolung may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19 by removal of CO 2 directly from the blood during extracorporeal therapy,"" said Mr. Peter M. DeComo, Chairman and CEO of ALung Technologies.
Mr. DeComo further stated, ""With published mortality rates as high as 90% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we believe that the Hemolung can be a valuable tool for physicians to be used in conjunction with IMV, by reducing or eliminating the potential of further lung damage caused by high ventilator driving pressures, often referred to as Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI). Many of the academic medical centers involved with our clinical trial have already requested the use of the Hemolung RAS for treatment of their COVID-19 patients.""

The coronavirus gets its name from the crown-like spikes on its surface, according to the CDC. (Corona is Latin for crown.) Including the newly identified form of the virus, there are a total of seven coronaviruses that can infect humans, the CDC says. Other well-known coronaviruses include SARS and MERS. https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-new-coronavirus-n1119081 NEWS:

CORONA VIRUS prevention strategy:. 	How are you handling all the coronavirus news ? Worried? Anxious? Fearful? Or are calmly watching and listening and making sure your immune system is in good shape and you have natural antivirals on hand if necessary? There are still many unknowns but I've been gathering some articles and resources for my own personal use. I’m not an expert in infections but since folks in my community are asking I promised to share my first-aid kit and rationale in a blog post. I can help with the anxiety and fear aspect if all this doesn’t put your mind at ease. I cover how I use individual amino acids with my clients at the end of this blog post. Vitamin C and other foundational nutrients This newly published blog by Andrew Saul PhD, Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus , offers sage foundational advice that resonates with what I already know: The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight: Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses. Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000) Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form) Zinc: 20 mg daily Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily Vitamin C, Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and selenium have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.
Number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia exceeds 15,000,. 	"The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has risen by 1,172 to 15,102, while the death toll has increased to 127 after six new fatalities have been confirmed, the country's Health Ministry said on Friday.
""The Health Ministry announces that it has registered 1,172 new coronavirus cases (COVID-19) and six more fatalities.
[The ministry has also] recorded 124 recoveries, which brings the total of recoveries to 2,049,"" the ministry said in an official statement.
According to the ministry's spokesman, the active cases in the country amount to 12,926, of which 93 patients are in critical condition.
The spokesman noted that 25 percent of those infected were Saudis, and 75 percent were were of other nationalities.
As of Thursday, a total of 13,930 people have been infected with the virus, including 121 fatalities since the beginning of the pandemic."
Malaysia Too Indebted To Communist China To Reject The Refugees Of Chinese Tourists From Corona Virus China. 	Not only have China done so many invaluable favours for Malaysia, the superpower's interest is strictly taken care of by Malaysia Baharu's government. DAP being the in the lead among PH component parties are preparing the warming up ground for China to run this nation behind the Malaysia Baharu mask. China will make sure DAP continues to stand as an unstoppable mountain wave until Muafakat Nasional is reduced to a ripple. The dreaded Communists are finally here to change the political landscape of Tanah Melayu into Tanah China, and we Malays have only ourselves to blame for being forever naive. As for the royalty, no need to worry about them. PH has made sure they are not in harm's way. As long as their interests are not touched. Only us Melayu Muslim rakyat will have to adjust shockingly to the Communist regime in the near future. The Wuhan Corona Virus may eliminate a chunk of anti communist and anti PH supporters, which will make Malaysia Baharu's ambition a sheer breeze with the horrendous, animal cruelty set of Chinese voters imported from Tanah Besar China. 
2019 novel corona virus no more dangerous than yearly flu. 	"The media hype is scaring people so much that nuts are actually threatening to shoot people who are currently in quarantine if they return home.
Utter stupidity typical of reactionaries in U.S. who seem to have no concept of logic or math.
Now that we have enough data to reach a conclusion it turns out that the 2019 nCoV china coronavirus is almost exactly as deadly as every year's influenza which people are so used to that they don't even get vaccinations.
As with measles getting vaccinated isn't just for your protection, it saves other lives.
The mortality (death) rate for this new coronavirus is estimated to be about 3.4% or exactly the same as an average flu season which kills between 20 and 60,000 in the U.S. each year.
The actual numbers today indicate about 2.2% mortality rate (910 deaths out of 40,000 infections) but it is spreading so fast that a very large portion of those 40,000 have only had the disease for one or two days.
This was initially unclear because China was very slow to disclose all the data they had. That, of course, makes no sense because they know it would eventually become public knowledge, just the usual secrecy of any dictatorship."
Queensland jockey Zoe White has disqualification halved for COVID-19 zoning breach. 	"For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here. By Adam Pengilly April 24, 2020 — 11.52am A Queensland apprentice jockey who was banned for six months for breaching COVID-19 zoning regulations has had her disqualification halved after an internal review.
The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission announced Zoe White, who was told by stewards to self-isolate for 14 days before riding trackwork at Rockhampton, would be on the sidelines for only three months.
Jockeys have been subject to strict coronavirus protocols to keep the industry going. Credit: AAP
Her penalty will expire on July 2.
It was the biggest sanction handed down to a horse-racing participant since the industry implemented its coronavirus guidelines, which include segregating jockeys into riding pools across the country.
Advertisement White was told to quarantine herself from March 30, but attended trackwork two days later.
Loading Racing NSW stewards banned Gai Waterhouse's loyal lieutenant Neil Paine from race meetings for a month after he sprinted across the mounting yard and embraced Waterhouse's co-trainer Adrian Bott following Farnan's record-breaking Golden Slipper win.
English jockey Tom Marquand was also fined $2000 for hugging Addeybb's strapper Safid Alam after the horse cleared away to win the Queen Elizabeth Stakes on the second day of The Championships.
Alam was hit with a $500 fine.
Thoroughbred racing is the only sport to have continued in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, except in Tasmania where it was shut down by the government."

Pakistan government Sensational Comments on Corona Virus. 	"With a very ordinary story, Sarileru Neekevvaru definitely achieved a rare feat with huge collections, that too when a blockbuster like Ala Vaikuntapuuram lo is running along. Instead of enjoying the great success, the team’s enthusiasm for claiming the ‘Industry Hit’ is turning into a big joke.
Though it is the weakest of all Anil Ravipudi’s films, Mahesh Babu’s stardom has become the savior of Sarileru Neekevvaru. Right from start, the team of Sarileru Neekevvaru had been constantly trying to put up numbers above that of Ala Vaikuntapurram lo.
The latest posters from Sarileru Neekevvaru mentioned ‘Industry Hit’ and ‘Non-Baahubali 2’, which means they claim to have taken over the collections of the first part of Baahubali. Even staying miles behind Ala.. in many areas, Sarileru Neekevvaru’s posters claiming to have beaten Baahubali 1 in AP and Telangana, is purely absurd.
The ‘Industry hit’ posters from Namrata and Sarileru team were hit back by sensible fans of Mahesh babu. They are asking not to defame Mahesh babu and his true fans with false numbers.
Well, if Mahesh’s next turn out to become a real blockbuster, then they should be showing many larger-non-existing numbers to prove it as a bigger success than Sarileru Neekevvaru."
Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS – REPORT. 	"If true, this radically lessens the likelihood of a global pandemic.
At the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published. All of these deaths have been in China. The disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020].
The Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians—specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as “ Oriental .”
Thus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC,com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be “Chinese nationals.” Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read “ First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , ” [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.
In fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a “Chinese tourist” [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28,"
Health Conscious Lady Pours Corona Beers Thinking It Would Spread Coronavirus. 	"A health conscious lady wearing face mask and gloves pours Corona beers down the sink thinking that it would spread coronavirus.
The novel coronavirus has become the headlines of numerous local and international news outlets after affecting thousands of people all across the globe. The disease is now spreading in different countries.
Many countries all around the world are now taking precautionary measures to prevent the rapid spread of the deadly virus that took the lives of some people. The virus allegedly originated from Wuhan, China.
The Philippine government is implementing stricter rules and regulations in monitoring the travelers coming from China. The health department also gives several health tips to the public as a precautionary measure against nCoV.
Recently, the Facebook page “AFF Suzuki Cup 2020” has shared the video footage of a health-conscious lady who opened bottles of Corona beer and poured it down the sink to get rid of the virus.
In the video, the woman identified as Jen Davies frantically pours bottles of her boyfriend’s Corona beers thinking that it would spread the disease. She even wears a face mask and gloves as she pours the beers.
The boyfriend identified as Brad Holmes begs his girlfriend to stop pouring his beers down the sink but Jen continues to perform her activity."
Corona Virus and the Rose Gold Flame. 	"As we have said, the silver ray is the feminine frequency within the body and the golden ray is the masculine frequency. When these merge or marry together (like two flints rubbing together), they create an internal fire (phire) that manifests as ‘the rose gold ray’ or ‘rose gold flame’ as it is activated. We also used the analogy of three aspects to the trinity. Each aspect being one unit of 33 and one third. We could say that the silver (female) aspect is one 33 and one third unit and the golden (male) aspect is the second 33 and one third unit. The third 33 and one third unit is the ‘creation’ or the ‘child’ (the rose gold flame). One symbol that shows this trinity field through geometry is the Celtic knot or ‘triquetra’. The twin flame presentation of the vesica piscis geometry depicts the masculine, the feminine and the creation as one aspect of the overall trinity, yet is a trinity in itself. Every aspect to each individualised, infinite structure is a holographic replica of the greater and the lesser aspect. Every structure is an ’emanation’ of another structure. The triquetra simply shows us the expanded presentation of the vesica piscis.
A quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire ‘journey’ of the DNA, if you will.
The first exercise we show you, involving the rose gold flame and the utilisation of the Schumann resonance as the antidote to the 5G scrambled field and the black box programme, is to use the symbol of the triquetra. There are several ways this can be done.
Meditation
Firstly, you can meditate upon the triquetra simply by visualising the symbol within meditation. You can also move into an ‘open-eyed’ meditation where you are in a relaxed, meditative space whilst looking at the triquetra symbol. You can also look at the symbol as the very last image you look at before you go to sleep at night. This is especially helpful if you wish to use dream magick and dream healing as part of your antidote creation. If you do decide to use the triquetra symbol as a trigger into dreamtime investigation/magick and healing, then you must ‘prepare your sleeping space’ before you do this. If you are sleeping outdoors in nature, there is no need to prepare your space as nature has already done this for you. Indoors, you would need to make sure all Wi-Fi and Internet signals are turned off in your home and all electronic equipment is removed from your bedroom. Make sure there is no metal within the mattress or bed frame you sleep upon, and do your best to utilise chemical-free bedding. Having crystals in your bedroom is especially helpful. Orgonite also.
Within your meditation or visualisation (closed or open-eyed looking at the triquetra image), imagine that the triquetra is a brilliant and bright silver colour. Make sure you hold that beautiful silver colour in your mind’s eye. You should feel an opening of the heart when doing this. Then imagine that the triquetra symbol is becoming a golden colour, getting brighter and brighter until all the silver colour has now been replaced with the gold. Then visualise the gold changing colour, taking on a pink hue and eventually becoming rose gold in colour. This is a very simple but very powerful exercise. This will trigger ‘downloads’ within dreamtime or meditation if you are a natural medium or channel. This exercise in itself can bring about balance and natural healing.
To strengthen and boost this exercise, you can keep rose quartz crystal by your bedside. A crystal wand or a crystal skull holds even more powerful, activating energy.
A quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire ‘journey’ of the DNA, if you will.
Shields that connect into Schumann resonance fields can also be created through water. Swimming in natural ocean water is an extremely powerful shield as the Schumann resonance is amplified through the oceans upon your planet. This can be recreated within your own bathtubs at home using Himalayan salts or any magnesium-based salts. Certain aromatherapy creations and herbs can also create shielding, as can placing crystals within the bathtub. The only case where it is not advisable to create a water shield in your bathtub, is when your bath is made of metal. This would scramble the signal and have the opposite effect (as in, lack of shield and focus away from Schumann resonance). The most powerful material for creating a water shield is stone such as crystal, followed by wood. A crystal bathtub full of sea salt is an absolute replica of the ocean and creates a ‘super conductor’ directly into the Schumann resonance fields. We also recommend you utilise a heavy metal detoxification programme. The reason for this is that metals within the organic human body system can ‘lock. on’ to the Wi-Fi 5G scrambled system and amplify it, so cleansing from heavy metals within the body is a shield in itself. The dark green leafy vegetables from the land and the seaweeds from unpolluted waters are able to chelate these heavy metals from the body. We recommend the blue-green algae also, such as chlorella and spirulina.
When you visualise the rose gold flame, you create an image in your mind’s eye that ‘activates’ through the pineal gland visual cortex system. The rose gold (and indeed the symbol of the rose itself) is a known symbol within what we may call the ‘cosmic alphabet’ or the ‘language of light’. When you visualise the rose gold flame, you speak directly to the DNA. When you create the rose gold flame as a shield, then the molecular structure within your body as silicate/crystalline follows suit (through a process similar to that which is known as ‘cymatics’and your entire energy field naturally keys into the Schumann resonance.
If enough individuals hold this belief system and follow similar spiritual exercises, then collectively the Schumann resonance will be spiked and kept at a high enough frequency to ‘drown out’ the 5G network and chemical bombardment. Either in meditation or in a relaxed state, we would ask you to visualise a silver candle and a gold candle. Both these candles burn one flame each. The silver candle burns a golden flame. The gold candle burns a silver flame. Sit with this visualisation for a few minutes, simply watching the candles and the burning flames. This exercise balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain, as well as communicating directly with the DNA about the shielding technique you are employing. The intrinsic intelligence within the cellular structure of the entire bodymind knows what you are doing. After a while, we would ask you to draw the candles closer and closer together until the silver candle burning a golden flame and the gold candle burning a silver flame become one candle and one flame. As the candles merge together, gold and silver, the colour of the candle begins to turn a beautiful rose colour with a matching rose coloured flame.
Yet The sparkle of the gold remains, creating a rose gold colour. You are now watching a rose gold candle burning a rose gold flame, and you are fully aware that the rose gold is a merge of the silver and the gold. Know that the right hemisphere of the brain (silver) and the left hemisphere of the brain (gold) have created a unified brain pattern, where the left and right hemispheres are in equal balance. Within the pineal gland, a beautiful diamond liquid crystal of a metallic rose gold colour has been created. This rose gold crystal liquid then seeps down from the brain stem into the throat, and you visualise yourself drinking this rose gold liquid. Know that this is ‘ambrosia’ or indeed ‘nectar of the Gods’. As you drink this delicious and sweet nectar, you visualise the flame of the rose gold candle getting bigger and bigger. The rose gold flame begins to surround you, like a ring of fire around you. The candle has unified with the flame and now, sitting in sacred space, there is just you surrounded by the rose gold flame ring of fire. Allow this ring of fire to completely surround you until it eventually becomes a ball of fire, like a rose-gold-pink orb, with you sitting in the centre, nurtured and protected.

By MAYOR ISKO MORENO
Mayor Isko Moreno
Before anything else, I would like to congratulate the bosses and staff of the Manila Bulletin on the occasion of our newspaper’s 120th founding anniversary yesterday (Sunday). So proud to have become a part of this prestigious institution which had been a purveyor of truth for over a century now.
Here’s wishing everyone from the Manila Bulletin a happy anniversary and with God’s grace, I’m certain that we will have many, many more anniversaries to come.
***
I’m simply at a loss for words with the recent outpouring of support the city government of Manila has been continuously getting, especially in the wake of fears spurred by the announcement of the Department of Health that a patient in San Lazaro Hospital had been confirmed to have contracted the 2019 novel corona virus.
Thousands upon thousands of face masks continue to arrive at my office as donations from private individuals and businessmen and just over the weekend, I received hundreds of high-tech infrared thermometers that can scan people and detect if they are running a fever. The thermometers, donated by Harwin Chen of MorganStar Co., can detect fever quickly and precisely, by just pointing the device at the forehead, thus doing away with any physical contact.
I can’t thank these kind-hearted donors enough, just as I am equally grateful to the officials and employes of the Manila City Hall, barangay leaders, and the residents, for their cooperation, help and support not only in maintaining clean surroundings as a deterrent to any illness borne by germs, but also in the city’s rigid information drive not only involving the corona virus but also other health programs.
So far, the city government of Manila has already distributed over 650,000 surgical and N95 face masks to city employees, barangays, students from the city’s 104 public elementary and high schools as well as colleges and jail personnel, among others. We are still slated to distribute more in the days to come, as donations continue arriving, thus augmenting the thousands initially purchased by the city for immediate distribution to the city employees, specially our health frontliners.
Apart from the 500,000 face masks given to students, we also handed over 6,200 face masks to the San Lazaro Hospital where suspected coronavirus cases are being treated, being one of the hospitals in the country with such capability.
Congratulations are in order for Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna who, as the supervising authority of the six city-run hospitals, has made sure that the hospitals are on their toes to guard against and be ready to treat anyone who might walk in with the symptoms attendant to the novel corona virus.
Ditto with Manila Health Department chief Dr. Arnold ‘Poks’ Pangan, who helped yours truly in conducting an intensive information drive about the corona virus way before a patient was confirmed to be carrying it.
The Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) personnel led by their chief, Dennis Viaje, also deserve commendation for their volunteerism, as they helped repack the face masks slated for distribution.
All these positive efforts and developments showing how Manilans can come together during times of impending crisis just make one proud to be a part of government, to be a Filipino.
Lamentably, these happy thoughts were marred by the chaos that took place over the weekend due to the panic buying of face masks in Bambang, Sta. Cruz, an area noted for the rows of establishments selling medical products.
Tension rose as most of the buyers claimed that they pre-ordered masks only to be told that the stocks had run out.
Whether this is true or not, we cannot rule out the possibility that some unscrupulous traders may just be taking undue advantage of the situation to gain profit. By creating artificial shortage in the supply of face masks, these traders can later resell their old stocks at higher prices.
I am appealing to these businessmen’s conscience. Please, do not put profit above everything else. Do not profit at the expense of your fellowmen’s suffering.
Always remember, what goes around, comes around…

Fear of China hampers fight against corona. 	"Xenophobia, ideology and the Western fear for China’s rise are the triple burdens that hinder the fight against the 2019 coronavirus (nCov).
Recently, Kevin Rudd, former Australian prime minister and president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York, wrote: “The wider world should show sympathy and express solidarity with the long-suffering Chinese people.
“These are ugly times and the racism implicit (and sometimes explicit) in many responses to Chinese people around the world makes me question just how far we have really come as a human family.”
Rudd’s people-centred global approach in the fight against coronavirus resonates with a well-known African idiom, Inxeba lendoda alihlekwa, used among the Nguni dialects, which simply means: “The wound of a man is not laughed at.”
In reporting on the coronavirus, The Wall Street Journal carried an article by Bard College Professor Walter Russell Mead, titled “China is the Real Sick Man of Asia”.
The professor and newspaper are well aware that the term “sick man of Asia” is a derogatory phrase that emanates from China’s century of humiliation at the hands of Western and Japanese powers.
Xenophobic tendencies against Chinese people have spread globally mainly through social media which constantly portrays the virus as having been caused by Chinese people’s eating habits.
The second frontal attack against the attempts by the Chinese authorities to speedily conquer the virus are cloaked in ideological clothes. There have been numerous opinion pieces in the Western media that are using the virus outbreak to directly attack President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. The main aim of such attacks are twofold: firstly, to advance the long-held view that liberal democracies handle and manage epidemics and general crises much better than what is considered as an authoritarian regime. The weakness of such an argument lies in the fact it is ahistorical. The US itself is littered with mismanagement of crises confronted by its people.
The Guardian newspaper in the UK carried an article by Emma Graham-Harrison on January 31,which argued: “China soon won international plaudits for a huge mobilisation, including the near impossible feat of building two new hospitals in as many weeks yet as information about the early days of the outbreak has slowly filtered out of China, it has become increasingly clear that the same political system that allowed Beijing to order such a dramatic response, also initially allowed the virus to foster.”
Lastly, the Western media and US officials use the coronavirus as a tool to limit the rise of China.
On January 24, a leading magazine in the US, Foreign Policy, unashamedly carried an article titled “Welcome to the Belt and Road Pandemic”.
Author Laurie Garrett wrote: “By making the Belt and Road Initiative endeavour - a multitrillion-dollar programme to expand Chinese trade and infrastructure around the world - the epicentre of his foreign and economic policy, Xi has made it possible for a local disease to become a global menace.”
At this juncture, there’s a need to build a united front in combating the spread of the disease and finding a cure. Africa has worked tirelessly with China within FOCAC on communicative diseases.
Hence it is important for Africa and China to double their efforts to manage the coronavirus. Africa has responded soberly to the outbreak without causing unnecessary panic on the markets and among its people. More efforts ought to be taken to strengthen Africa’s healthworkers response.
But this can be done showing ubuntu, rejecting the triple burdens in the fight against the disease - xenophobia, ideological differences and the fear of China’s rise."

Swiss catch last flights home during Covid-19 travel freeze. 	"Almost 7,000 Swiss residents who were stuck abroad are being brought home. A flight from India and one from Africa will conclude the largest repatriation operation ever mounted by the Swiss foreign ministry.
It was launched a month ago in cooperation with the airlines Swiss, Edelweiss und Helvetic. In total 35 flights have been organised from all parts of the world, including destinations which usually have no direct flights to Switzerland.
Once the flights have touched down, the next phase will be about providing support for Swiss citizens who have been unable or unwilling to return to Switzerland.
The repatriation flights needed a lot of diplomacy, security assessments and arranging of special flight permits. Passengers will cover the main share of the costs by paying the equivalent of the market rate for a standard fare for their flight. "
AstraZeneca Initiates Phase III Trial of Diabetes Drug Farxiga (Dapagliflozin) for COVID-19 Treatment - COVID-19 . 	AstraZeneca Initiates Phase III Trial of Diabetes Drug Farxiga (Dapagliflozin) for COVID-19 Treatment By HospiMedica International staff writers Posted on 24 Apr 2020 Illustration AstraZeneca (Cambridgeshire, England), along with Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, has initiated a randomized, global Phase III trial to assess the potential of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) as a treatment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at risk of developing serious complications, such as organ failure. The goal of the trial, called DARE-19, is to assess whether Farxiga, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, can reduce the risk of disease progression, clinical complications, and death due to COVID-19 in patients who also have cardiovascular (CV), metabolic or kidney risk factors. AstraZeneca is rapidly mobilizing its COVID-19 research efforts to focus on key areas: identifying novel coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent or treat disease progression; and investigating the application of the company’s new and existing medicines to suppress the body’s overactive immune response, or protect from serious complications, such as organ failure caused by COVID-19 disease. Farxiga is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalization for heart failure or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care. DARE-19 is an international, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Farxiga in addition to background local standard of care therapy, on the risk of all-cause death or disease progression and complications in adults who are hospitalized with COVID-19 at the time of trial enrolment. Patients enrolled in DARE-19 also have a medical history of hypertension (HTN), atherosclerotic CV disease, heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, T2D or CKD Stage III to IV. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial is time to first occurrence of death from any cause or new/worsened organ dysfunction through 30 days of follow-up. “AstraZeneca is committed to finding new solutions to fight COVID-19 by investigating the application of our new and existing medicines. With the Phase III DARE-19 trial, we aim to test whether Farxiga can prevent serious complications such as organ failure in those patients with pre-existing health conditions, a critical goal when treating COVID-19,” said Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. “Dapagliflozin has demonstrated cardio and renal protective benefits and improved outcomes in high-risk patients with type-2 diabetes, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and chronic kidney disease. Patients with COVID-19 and underlying cardiometabolic disease appear to be at the highest risk of morbid complications. Through DARE-19, we hope to decrease the severity of illness, and prevent cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney decompensation, which are common in patients with COVID-19,” said Mikhail N. Kosiborod, M.D., cardiologist at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Vice President of Research at Saint Luke's Health System, and principal investigator of DARE-19.
New COVID-19 normal could lead to stronger regulations for parlours, salons: Health Minister. 	"Health Minister Adrian Dix says re-opening hair salons and other personal grooming services will require a dramatic change in the way people operate.
Dix says post-COVID-19 world will likely include stronger oversight of hairstylists, tattoo parlours and nail salons in B.C.
“How do we make adjustments? Both to rebuild public confidence and to ensure there’s public confidence to go to establishments, should they be allowed to operate, but also start to do the work now to ensure that it could be done safely and this is required across B.C. society and across the economy,” he says.
According to Dix it’s been 17 years since those businesses were de-regulated by the former Liberal government.
“What will be required, at the very minimum, is to meet the standards being put in place by the provincial health officer. Whether that would require new legislation, I don’t know. But with the health orders such as we have in place, it will require a dramatic change in the way people operate,” Dix says.
He adds this crisis gives this industry a chance to raise standard levels, not only to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but to boost overall confidence from the public. "

30 Jan 2020 - Coronaviruses (CoV) have been identified as human pathogens since the 1960’s. ... Zoonotic coronaviruses have emerged in recent years to cause human outbreaks, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) since 2012.
SARS had died 2003 as I sent the idea of by any immune drip of interleukin two and four, at level senior patiently, from a standard infection, to patients with any novel infection.
Is stimulated secretion an actioning of the active human antibody. Which will clear any infection! Using my HIUS device for ½ minute to each side the chest, causes viral cells to boil and pop.
And the body's own immune system then generates interleukin two and four. So the application of HIUS cures all infections. Included AIDs and the common cold. The common coal kills 5000 UK citizens a year, even before hospital and Dr. Involvement.
Application of HIUS for ½ minute to each side the chest will clear all viral infections including Corona. And a every registered Dr. On earth has suitable HIUS Equipment in the nursing office.
Their Hippocratic N oath does not permit any registered Dr. Had to research alternative cures to cured conditions. Corona is cured. A research work on vaccines to Corona, strikes off all the medical team.
Corona virus is so much less important virus than flu. It has a much lower fatality rate them cells all the common cold. Every Dr. on earth must now use HIUS! And they are doing.
Which is why the Corona is dying away!

nCoV-2019 isn’t a novel virus: Other views. 	"“Seventeen years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them. ... By far, the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. ... Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: One had just a single health care worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments. The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training.” OUR VIEW: Coronavirus offers reasons for concern but not for panic David Quammen , The New York Times : “‘Novel coronavirus of 2019’ ... isn’t as novel as you might think. ... Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, (is) a senior author of the draft paper that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics. ... When you’re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances, (which) include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis, but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume — with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan, China.” Frank Sieren , Deutsche Welle , Germany: “The scale of Beijing’s measures so far is unprecedented. Only an authoritarian one-party state could have implemented them so rapidly: Some 56million people are under quarantine and air, rail and long-distance bus traffic has been suspended in at least 14 cities. What is incredible is that there have been no demonstrations, let alone riots, in the regions affected. ... The situation was different with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak: The scale of the epidemic was played down for months. By the time it had been brought under control, 800 people had died. Now, Beijing is providing information about the number of cases and casualties almost every hour. Even the construction of the new hospital is ... live-streamed.” Vin Gupta , NBC News : ""As a pulmonologist in Seattle, near where the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in the United States last week, I relied heavily on the city’s hospitals, clinics and departments of health to protect our community. And they did so admirably, immediately acting decisively and shrewdly despite the fear and uncertainty that always arises with an invisible biological threat. ... Just 0.19% of the U.S. budget goes toward pandemic preparedness overseas. Yet any money that we do spend means we mitigate the risk of facing outbreaks at home. ... It’s not just inadequate funding that keeps us behind. Two high-profile global health security experts departed the administration in 2018, diminishing the chances that leadership from within may change these dangerous realities. Which means that unless hospitals and providers are given the necessary financial resources, Americans may soon be more vulnerable to threats like Ebola and coronavirus that pay no attention to politics or budgetary cycles but which demand a health system ready and primed to respond.""

Paul Stoffels , M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, ""We have set a high bar. Johnson & Johnson has committed to rapidly produce and supply more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine globally. Our collaboration with Emergent is proof that we are moving quickly to deliver on that promise.""
Under the terms of this manufacturing agreement, Johnson & Johnson is investing to expand drug substance capacity related to the vaccine candidate. Emergent will provide drug substance manufacturing services with its molecule-to-market CDMO offering, beginning in 2020, and will also reserve operations capacity to potentially support commercial manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine candidate leveraging Janssen's proven AdVac® and PER.C6 ® technologies beginning in 2021.
The Company has already begun preparations for clinical vaccine production at its facility in Leiden, the Netherlands , with the aim of initiating Phase 1 human clinical studies of its vaccine candidate in September 2020. Johnson & Johnson will begin production at risk and is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.
Simultaneously, Johnson & Johnson is also aiming to rapidly scale up vaccine manufacturing capabilities globally, including increasing capacity in countries outside the U.S. The additional global capacity will assist in the rapid production of a vaccine and enable the supply of more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine to people around the world.
For more than 20 years, Johnson & Johnson has invested billions of dollars in antivirals and vaccine capabilities. The COVID-19 vaccine program leverages Janssen's proven AdVac ® and PER.C6 ® technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. The same technology was used to develop and manufacture the Company's investigational Ebola vaccine and construct our RSV and HIV vaccine candidates which are in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical development stages.
COVID-19 belongs to a group of viruses called coronaviruses that attack the respiratory system. There is currently no approved vaccine, treatment or cure for COVID-19.

The 2019-nCoV Corona Virus. 	"There has been much talk and much misinformation being spread about the Corona Virus that is currently hitting China hard. As a statistician, I thought I would help to shed some light on the topic in terms that most of us can understand.
My data that I am using here is taken primarily from two sources:
Time - Map - John - Hopkins - University 1. The real time interactive map that John Hopkins University is using to present the current status and trend of the virus.
2. A Lancet Medical Journal article published a week ago and updated/corrected February 4th.
Image - Part - Map - China - Data The first image is part of a map of China. The data was updated as of 7:43 p.m. EST on Thursday. It is changing rapidly! The largest red circles that you see represent the provinces that have at least 1000 cases. When I started writing this post earlier this evening, there was only one large red circle, it contained 22,000 of the approximate 31,000 cases. By 8:30 when I saved this map there were two large circles. By 9:00 p.m. there were three. Within the next day or two there will be several more. This by the way is only confirmed cases. There is likely a multiplier effect of those who had such mild symptoms, that they did not even register as cases.
So what do we know?
Virus - Market - Wuhan - Interaction The virus originated in a market in Wuhan through animal human interaction.
Wuhan is a major transportation hub, and the start of the virus corresponded with the Chinese Lunar New Year, when many were travelling.
Virus - Rate - Lancet - Journal - Article The virus is spreading at an exponential rate. The Lancet Journal article estimated a doubling of the number of cases every 6.4 days. From recent data, cumulative deaths are doubling about every four days."
Trudeau announces $1.1-billion for COVID-19 research. 	"Plan includes an investment of close to $115-million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities The federal government will spend $1.1-billion to mobilize researchers to find a vaccine or other treatments for COVID-19, support clinical trials and expand national testing, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau said the plan includes an investment of close to $115-million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities and more than $662-million for clinical trials led by Canadian researchers.
The plan also includes a commitment of $350-million to expand national testing and modelling of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the creation of an immunity task force to help determine the true extent of virus across Canada and the potential for reinfection before a vaccine is developed.
“A vaccine is the long-term solution to this virus, but these drugs will take months to develop a test, fabricate and roll out,” Mr. Trudeau said at his daily news briefing on Thursday.
Former University of Toronto president David Naylor and McGill University’s Catherine Hankins, a global health expert, will co-chair the panel, which will also include Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam, chief science adviser Mona Nemer and Tim Evans, director of McGill’s school of population and global health, Mr. Trudeau said.
“Canada’s best and brightest will be working on serology testing, blood testing to track and understand immunity to COVID-19. They’ll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we’ve already tested have had COVID-19, whether you’re immune once you’ve had it and, if so, how long that lasts,” Mr. Trudeau said.
Dr. Naylor said the task force will work to get a sense of background immunity against COVID-19 across the country, saying it’s important to get a big-picture view and look at vulnerable communities.
He said they will be doing longitudinal work to see how immunity of individuals changes over time and if people get reinfected. He said the task force will also work with scientists to get an in-depth understanding of biology of immunity to the virus.
“We still don’t know how big the iceberg is in this strange viral disease,” he said.
Mr. Trudeau said that over the course of two years, at least a million Canadians will be tested as part of the group’s study. The findings of the research will help with rolling out a potential vaccine and determining future public-health measures, he said.
Isaac Bogoch, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Toronto and the University Health Network in Toronto, was enthused by the announcement and said that funding for research is of tremendous need to improve diagnostics, therapeutics and prevention of COVID-19.
Dr. Bogoch said the task force will be able to gain a better understanding of the pandemic’s impact because they will be able to collect data that will help focus public-health policy.
“For example, to what extent are people who have recovered from COVID-19 immune? And if so, how long does that immunity last for? Those are extremely important questions to answer because you can … focus vaccine research around this. You can also target prevention methods in these populations as well,” he said.
Dr. Bogoch also explained that the type of testing Mr. Trudeau raised – serology testing – determines whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past. This testing is not yet being done in Canada. He said there are multiple companies and academic groups working on serological tests and they will be used in the country soon.
Mr. Trudeau said it may be a long time before there is a vaccine for COVID-19, but that there are discussions around treatments that might work.
“A vaccine, obviously, arriving soon would be the best solution,"" the Prime Minister said. ""But we need to make sure we are exploring all different ways of ensuring that Canadians’ quality of life and safety and protection is upheld in the best way we possibly can going forward.”
Unlike the more than $50-million in federal research grants for coronavirus studies made earlier this year, before Canada felt the full brunt of COVID-19, the science focus of Thursday’s much larger announcement was clearly aimed at dealing with a pandemic in full swing.
“We are in a different phase … the virus is here,” said Charu Kaushic, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton and scientific director of the Institute for Infection and Immunity, part of Canada’s medical research apparatus.
Dr. Kaushic said there was enough capacity within the research community to absorb the new funds, in part because researchers in related fields are now coming forward with ideas and projects that may help battle the virus, reduce infections and improve outcomes for patients.
“Scientists are going all out to say, ‘I’m here. What can I do?’ ” Dr. Kaushic said. “Will it make a difference? I hope so.”

All severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan cured: official. 	"A recovered novel coronavirus pneumonia patient at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University pose for a photo with Li Lanjuan, center, a renowned Chinese epidemiologist, before she was discharged from the hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, on March 16, 2020. As the last COVID-19 patient with severe symptoms was cured on Friday, cases in severe and critical condition in Wuhan, Hubei province have been cleared, according to Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission.
A 90-year-old man surnamed Zhang tested negative for the novel coronavirus at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University on Friday, showing all patients in severe and critical condition were cured in Hubei province, the region hardest hit by the epidemic on Chinese mainland.
Since Jan 28, 21 teams with 2,801 medics, including renowned epidemiologist Li Lanjuan, have poured into the eastern branch of the hospital to support treatment of patients with severe symptoms.
As of Friday, 1,474 patients have been cured and discharged from the hospital.
The number of current confirmed cases in Hubei fell under 50 for the first time on Thursday. No new confirmed infections or suspected cases have been reported in the province for 20 consecutive days, Mi said.
The Chinese mainland reported six confirmed cases as of Thursday, the lowest daily increase since the epidemic began, according to the commission."

Assuming human error was at fault it's quite possible the error wasn't noticed, or if it was that they hoped nothing would come of it as they didn't want to face repercussions.
If the severity of the virus is all ready known from lab work it would explain the strong response from the Chinese government when they became aware what it was as they already have studied the potential risk from it.
Out of all the wet markets in China it just so happens that It occurs beside the their level 4 lab who have researchers specialising in novel Corona viruses in bats."

Enforcement Policy for Imaging Systems During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Emergency. 	"Docket Number: FDA-2020-D-1138 Issued by: Guidance Issuing Office Office of Medical Products and Tobacco, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of medical x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging systems, and image analysis software that are used to diagnose and monitor medical conditions while mitigating circumstances that could lead to patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare technology management (HTM) exposure to COVID-19 for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, and renewed for 90 days on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020.
This policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).
Given this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled "" Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 ,"" this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.

Only 10% Of Pulses Promised Under COVID-19 Relief Package Distributed So far. 	"Pulses amounting to 1 kg per family which was announced as part of the COVID-19 relief package about a month ago to the beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) are yet to reach many homes in the economically poor sections of the country.
According to an Indian Express report, hardly 19,496 ton out of the total monthly allocation of 1.95 lakh metric ton (LMT) pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY), have been issued by the states till April 22, revealed the data compiled by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. The ministry is involved in monitoring the supply of essential items during the nationwide lockdown.
The responsibility of ensuring the supply of pulses from the buffer stocks has been given to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), which is under the administrative control of the Agriculture Ministry.
The Finance Ministry stated in a statement on ""Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Progress So Far"" on April 23 stated that ""1,09,227 MT of Pulses have also been dispatched"" to various states and Union Territories (UTs).
The Food Ministry&apos;s data, however, revealed that against a monthly allocation of 1,95,531 MT pulses under PMGKAY, to provide pulses free of cost to 19.55 crore families under NFSA, only 1,22,312 MT have been issued to states. The data further shows that out of this, 44,932 MT have been sent to ""destination"" states, 34,768 MT received by these states, and only 19,496 MT distributed to the beneficiaries.
Despite the announcement of PMGKAY on March 26, a day after PM Modi announced nationwide lockdown to contain novel coronavirus, the apathy in distribution is due to delay in the milling process by NAFED, sources in the Food Ministry have informed.
""We have to distribute free pulses to 19.55 crore families for three months across all 36 states and UTs. In big states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the number of eligible beneficiaries is quite high and, therefore, the allocation is high, (so) we are taking some time,"" a senior official of NAFED was Quote: d as saying. He added that NAFED is sending pulses to these states.
According to the official pulses have been dispatched to UTs such as Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Puducherry and Chandigarh, and smaller states such as Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura. ""Buffer stock of pulses is always kept un-milled (whole), and the milling process takes some time,"" the official further said.
The central nodal agency for procurement of notified agricultural commodities, including pulses, NAFED is under the Price Support Scheme run by the Agriculture Ministry.
The agency also maintains a buffer stock of pulses under the Price Stabilisation Fund Scheme administered by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
Earlier the Food Ministry officials had flagged a slow response in the supply of pulses to the states. The Cabinet Secretary is learnt to have directed the concerned officials from the Agriculture Ministry and NAFED to speed up supply.
""To ensure adequate availability of protein to all the above-mentioned individuals, 1 kg pulses per family would be provided according to regional preferences for the next three months. These pulses would be provided free of cost by the Government of India.,"" the government stated in a statement issued on March 26."
"Futures Hit Record High On Optimism That ""Corona Is Contained"". "	"And sure enough, less than 24 hours later, in an attempt to explain the return of overnight market euphoria Reuters writes that ""world stock markets looked to be getting back to full strength on Wednesday, as updates from China about the spread of a new flu-like coronavirus raised hopes the outbreak would be contained "" and Bloomberg doubled-down that ""U.S. equity-index futures gained on Wednesday as China took steps to contain the spread of a deadly virus"", which is ironic since just moments ago China's CCTV reported that there are now 473 confirmed Coronavirus cases in China , with many cases now observed internationally, and most recently, a Coronavirus case were confirmed in Hong Kong as the epidemic spreads. And yet, after dropping by 9 points yesterday, S&P futures have more than made up those losses and are up 14 points as of Wednesday morning.
China’s National Health Commission said on Wednesday there were 440 cases of the new virus, with nine deaths so far, and added that measures are now in place to minimize public gatherings in the most-affected regions. How one can prevent people from gathering in China, the world's most congested nation, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the outbreak has spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The World Health Organization meets later on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international emergency.
In other words, despite what a handful of algos would like to telegraph, the Coronavirus is anything but contained , with the outbreak reviving memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. And the punchline: according to Reuters, ""this time China’s response and candour — in contrast to the SARS epidemic — have helped reassure investors concerned about the possible global fallout."" Actually, the ""response and candour"" confirm, if anything, that China is panicking, but as usual the market is never wrong, until it is.
“The call here is not that the virus is done or nipped in the bud by any means,” said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “But there have been no big further reported outbreaks, and the response from the Chinese authorities has been very, very positive”.
""I would expect a lot of people - candidly, like we are - that are looking for opportunities to buy rather than sell” amid the dip in stocks caused by virus-contagion worries, Lamar Ville re, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co., said on Bloomberg TV. “I don’t think this is going to be the beginning of the end.”
Because one obviously ""buys rather then sells"" when stocks are trading at never before seen highs.
In any case, optimism that ""Corona is Contained"" helped European stocks in London, Frankfurt and Paris score early gains of 0.1% to 0.2%. European equities first erased initial gains to mirror whiplash price action for stocks in Asia, where early losses reversed after Beijing outlined measures to contain the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, however it has since rebounded again.
Earlier in the session, Asian stocks resumed their climb, rebounding from the last session led by consumer-staples and technology companies. The benchmark stock gauge recovered about half of Tuesday’s losses, with most markets in the region gaining. Shares in Hong Kong also rebounded, with technology stocks and insurers boosting the Hang Seng Index. Chinese shares erased losses after Beijing said it will start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.
MSCI’s airline industry index .posted its biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. Airline shares were still falling on Wednesday.
“While details on the coronavirus are scant, we reckon that the SARS period could offer some clues as to how markets could pan out,” analysts at Singapore’s DBS Bank said. “The trends are clear: Yields and stock prices fell in the first few months of the SARS outbreak and rebounded thereafter.”
And yes, the return of Fed-backstopped euphoria means a new record high in the US too where S&P 500 futures just hit a new all time high, reaching Michael Hartnett's target of 3,333 more than one month ahead of schedule (March 3).
In rates, US 10Y Treasurys were unchanged with the yield on U.S. 10-year government bonds stabilizing after Tuesday’s drop, sitting at 1.78% US10YT=RR in European trading. Core European and U.K. bond yields are also little changed across most of the curves. Italian government bond yields rose as much as 8 basis points on reports the leader of the country’s 5-Star party and foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, will step down, however they recovered all losses after it was confirmed that he is indeed stepping down. It was the biggest, if brief, sell-off in a month and raised the risk of another snap election in Europe’s fourth-largest economy, since 5-Star is part of Italy’s coalition government.
“The initial reaction was to sell because of the heightened political uncertainty,” said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit in Milan. “But there is no outright link between de Maio’s resignation and a collapse of the government.”
In FX, with markets generally rising, safe plays such as gold and the Japanese yen were weaker. The dollar was rising toward the highs it reached in December against the other top world currencies. The yen dipped after gaining Tuesday on news of the contagion and potential disruption to spending during China’s week-long Lunar New Year. The yuan steadied, after tumbling the most in almost five months Tuesday in onshore trading.
In commodities, gold gave back some gains to trade at $1,555 per ounce; West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $58 a barrel and natural gas gained 1% to $1.91 per mmbtu.

Chinese officials stepped up monitoring of transportation links in China and ordered a nearly complete shutdown of the city of Wuhan where the virus originated, as the death toll increased to nine President Trump tells CNBC in interview from Davos that “I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen,” he says, according to transcript provided by the network U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there are no deadlines to start talks on a phase-two agreement, during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland The Federal Reserve averted a year-end liquidity crunch by pumping $256 billion into repurchase markets. The consequences are now rippling across the globe as Japanese bonds have become less attractive to U.S.-based investors, while yen-funded investors now find European bonds and U.S. credit more alluring Xavier Rolet is stepping down as chief executive officer of billionaire Michael Hintze’s hedge fund firm, just a year after taking the role. Rolet is leaving for “reasons unconnected with CQS,” according to an emailed statement from the hedge fund. Former UBS Group AG trader Kweku Adoboli fought to avoid deportation from the U.K. to the nation of his birth after his conviction for a $2.3 billion loss at the Swiss bank. Now, he is seeking a comeback in Ghana with a plan to kick-start its mortgage-backed bond market Malaysia’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday, the latest emerging market to ease monetary policy amid an uncertain global economy. Asian equity markets gradually improved and shrugged off the lacklustre lead from Wall St, where all major indices snapped their streak of record closes amid jitters related to the coronavirus with 440 cases reported in China and the death toll now at 9, while the CDC also confirmed the first case of the virus in the US. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) managed to rebound from opening weakness as outperformance in Consumer Staples, Tech and Healthcare underpinned the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment was mainly driven by currency moves but with weakness seen in some automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using emission cheating devices. KOSPI (+1.2%) gained with Hyundai Motor boosted amid earnings despite missing expectations on Q4 net as it still showed a turnaround from the loss Y/Y and both its operating profit and revenue topped forecasts. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) nursed some of the prior day’s near-3% losses and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) eventually joined in on the recovery after it initially slipped to its lowest levels so far this year due to the ongoing outbreak fears and after experts suggested the possibility of a mutation in the coronavirus. Finally, 10yr JGBs were indecisive amid a pullback in T-notes which retraced some of the prior day’s advances after hitting resistance around 129.20 and with prices also failing to benefit despite slightly firmer demand at the enhanced-liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs.

Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows – on the back of Di Maio’s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader. On the other end of the spectrum, SMI (+0.6%) outperforms with almost all of its stocks in positive territory. Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall market sentiment. In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+1.7%) shares are supported after a source noted that Boeing doesn’t expect regulators to sign off on the 737 Max until June or July, months later than the manufacturer previously expected. Traders also attribute the losses in Tui (-4.3%) to the Boeing news. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete.

Rolet to Step Down as CEO of Billionaire Hintze’s Hedge Fund CQS U.K. Government Spending Soars as Austerity Continues to Thaw ECB Hits Fifth Anniversary of QE Still Puzzled by Inflation Gap Greece’s Lawmakers Elect Country’s First Woman Head of State In FX, although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China’s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday’s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning?
JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD - The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs. Elsewhere, Sterling is rangy in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms either side of 1.3050 and 0.8500 awaiting Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs that could well be the final jigsaw pieces for next week’s BoE policy meeting, and similarly the Loonie is biding time between 1.3050-1.3100 in the run up to Canadian CPI just before the BoC. EM - The Rand continues its recovery from worst levels after in line SA CPI and last week’s surprise SARB ease prompted Usd/Zar upside to test the 200 DMA yesterday, but also as the Dollar stalls after another look at the same DXY chart resistance level around 97.720. However, the Rouble is fading after a fleeting relief rally on the formation of a new Russian Government alongside oil prices towards 62.0000 again. In commodities, WTI and Brent front-month futures remain lacklustre in mid-week trade – with participants pointing dampened sentiment on the coronavirus outbreak alongside demand woes for the complex, amid lower demand from airlines in light of cancelled flights ahead of the Chinese Lunar Year. Bearish supply-side fundamentals also weigh on the futures as EIA expects US total shale oil production to rise by 22k BPD in February to 9.2mln, with a predominant increase by the Permian. WTI meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the Brent contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar’20 futures test yesterday’s low just above 64/bbl. As a reminder, the weekly API Private crude inventories will be released later today on account of Monday’s MLK US market holiday. Spot gold prices have clambered off overnight lows after a test of the 1550/oz to the downside and ahead of potential modest resistance at its 50 HMA (~1559/oz) which did cap gains in the yellow metal during yesterday’s session. Meanwhile, copper prices found an overnight base around 2.8/lb but ultimately remains flat intraday.

A look at my Davos stats from yesterday shows around 20,000 steps and 10 miles of trekking around town to various meetings and events. I think 3 miles of that was taking a forced detour as Mr Trump’s motorcade came through town. We hosted a fascinating panel on sustainability pitting NYT best selling author Andrew McAfee who’s written an optimistic tome (More From Less) against Tim Jackson - an ecological economist - who has written a more pessimistic book (Prosperity Without Growth). It made for a lively debate and in all my interactions its clear that the number of these conversations are rising exponentially. In talking about our Davos piece on this topic (link here) at a separate meeting, one client explained one of the dilemmas they face. They invest in African development and mentioned that surely everyone would want health improvements in the continent - especially the poorer parts. However his assertion was that the only way that can happen in the immediate future is if their energy consumption increases which in turn potentially damages the planet. Raising the awareness of such trade-offs is one of the main themes of our report and this is where more and more attention needs to be focused.
It’s fair to say that the two headline grabbers of Davos yesterday have different views on the issue. President Trump said that “we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse”. It’s fair to say Greta Thunberg took the polar opposite view. Elsewhere in Mr Trump’s speech, he trumpeted the achievements of his administration, criticised the Federal Reserve once again for not cutting rates fast enough, and also said that talks with China on phase two would start “very shortly”. Later on, ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said that “we’re going to talk about a big trade deal” and that it was “something that we all want to be able to make.” However, Trump also said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he was “absolutely serious” when it comes to putting tariffs on European cars if a trade deal couldn’t be reached.
In terms of today at Davos, Von der Leyen will actually be one of the main speakers, with an address at 11:30 CET, while there’s a potentially interesting panel on the future of financial markets a bit earlier at 10:30 CET, which includes IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, along with the US and UK finance ministers, Steven Mnuchin and Sajid Javid.
Back to markets, and equities sold off yesterday as the US returned from a holiday, with investors becoming a bit more cautious around the world amidst the continued spread of a new coronavirus in China. Reports that a case had been discovered in the US helped reverse a gradual rally back in markets prior to the last couple of hours of US trading. More on the US session below but the latest on the virus is that with the death toll increasing to 9 from 6, China is likely to start nationwide screening as officials are stepping up the monitoring of transportation links in the country. The confirmed cases of the infection have reached 440 as of January 21 (from 218 on January 20) and 1,394 patients are under medical observation. Including the detection in the US, the virus has now stretched to 5 additional countries with Macau reporting its first case overnight. Elsewhere, the WHO is going to decide today as to whether to declare the virus an international public health emergency. China has said that as of now it has seen no evidence of “super spreaders” - infected people who pass on the disease rapidly to many other people - but could not rule out that some would emerge. Super spreaders played a key role in the SARS pandemic 17 years ago, which killed almost 800 people and hurt economies across the region.
Assessing the economic impact of the coronavirus, our Asian economists draw conclusions from the past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (link here) and conclude that the impact from any spread of the disease would be felt most in the form of a sharp decline in retail sales, tourism, hotel & catering and travel activities as people try to avoid infection by restricting travel and people to people contact. Also, if necessary, public health measures might get introduced to reduce infections by imposing quarantines and closing schools which could result in a higher impact. But most other services and trade and manufacturing activities are unlikely to be affected much, in their view; and consumption and travel can be expected to recover quickly, even before the authorities give the all clear as observed during the SARS and MERS outbreak. The big problem is that as the Lunar New Year holidays approach it might prove hard for China to contain. Some good news is that China have been forthcoming and transparent about the spread of this coronavirus as they involved the WHO very early on and have also shared the genetic sequencing of the virus to allow early detection of cases in other countries. This is unlike what happened with SARS which first came to light in China in November 2002 but only got widespread attention after the first cases were detected in Hong Kong in February 2003.
Overnight in Asia, markets are making advances as investors are moderating their concerns over the virus. The Nikkei (+0.59%), Hang Seng (+1.25%) and Kospi (+1.00%) are all up. Meanwhile, the CSI (+0.08%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.02%) are trading flattish. As for Fx, the Japanese yen is down -0.15% while most Asian currencies are making modest advances. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.47% and yields on 10y USTs are up +1.2bps while, gold is trading down -0.33% and oil prices are down -0.40%. As for overnight data releases, South Korea’s preliminary 4Q GDP printed at +2.2% yoy (vs. +1.9% yoy expected).
Before this the S&P 500 fell back from its record high from Friday, ending the session down -0.26%. It was a similar story elsewhere, with the NASDAQ (-0.19%) and the Dow Jones (-0.52%) also seeing declines. Boeing (-3.33%) saw another tough session. Before this in Europe, the STOXX 600 pulled back from its intraday low of -0.99% to close just -0.14% lower. Nevertheless the risk-off sentiment supported sovereign debt, with 10yr Treasuries down -5.7bps to 1.766%, while the 2s10s curve flattened by -2.5bps. Gilt yields fell -1.9bps to their lowest level since October, while bunds (-3.1bps) and OATs (-3.0bps) also saw yields move lower. Italy was the exception, where the spread of BTPs over bunds widened by +4.9bps ahead of lots of political news flow of late and a regional election on Sunday. That said, they’re still holding the 150-170bps range seen since mid-November so it’ll be interesting to see if political risk leads to a break out.
Looking at yesterday’s earnings, UBS shares fell -4.53% after the company reported that last year’s net profit attributable to shareholders was down -5% year-on-year, with the bank also lowering their targets moving forward. Bank stocks were subdued generally yesterday, with the STOXX Banks index closing down -0.47% at a one-month low, though UBS isn’t a member of that particular index.
Staying with earnings, Netflix reported overnight and said that it added 8.76mn subscribers in 4Q (+20% yoy). However, it forecasted slower subscriber growth in the current quarter at 7mn (vs. 7.82mn) expected. The stock was up +2.38% in afterhours trading. IBM also reported with a slight beat. The stock was up +3.83% after hours.
Over in FX, sterling was the strongest-performing G10 currency yesterday, as the UK employment numbers ended a run of pretty weak data from the country. The 3m/3m employment change rose to +208k (vs. +110k expected) in November, its highest rate since January, while the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations. In response, investors lowered the odds of a rate cut from the BoE at next week’s meeting after the data release, with the chances falling to around 60%, having been at 70.5% at the close on Friday. Our economists point out (link here) though that most of yesterday’s announced employment gains have been government led so it shouldn’t change the view on a necessary rate cut too much. The last big data release before the BoE meeting will be the preliminary January PMIs on Friday, so the market will be paying close attention.
Meanwhile in Germany, the ZEW Survey beat expectations, with the current situation reading rising to -9.5 (vs. -13.5 expected), while the expectations reading rose to 26.7 (vs. 15.0 expected), the strongest reading for the expectations indicator since July 2015. So a note of optimism ahead of tomorrow’s ECB meeting.
In terms of the day ahead there are a number of key highlights. From central banks, the Bank of Canada will be deciding on rates, while Bank of England Governor Carney will be speaking at the Bloomberg Climate Forum in Davos. Earnings releases out today include Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, ASML and Texas Instruments. Finally on the data, we’ll get French business confidence in January, Italian industrial sales and industrial orders from November, UK public sector net borrowing for December, Canada’s December CPI reading, and finally US existing home sales for December and the FHFA house price index for November.

Cameroonian Survive Corona Virus Because of Melanin in China. 	"The Coronavuris is taking lives in china and is a called for concern as we need to survive while going about our daily business. The Coronavuris has affected business in china and we at ransbiz.com though we could keep you updated as it is n emergency call. We have a good number of our webste users in china and we hope you all stay safe. A facebook user by name Zanomoya KaTshatshu Mditshwa made the post below about Coronavuris in China.
OUR MELANIN IS OUR DEFENSE ""SENOU (pictured above) is a young Cameroonian student in China recently infected with # Coronavuris he was released from hospital this morning cured of the virus. Chinese doctors have confirmed that he remained alive because he has black skin, the antibodies of a black are 3 times strong, powerful,and resistant as that of a white. # Coronavirus killed more than 800 people at less than 1 month in China, not easy to survive this virus.
#237 # CAMEROON # Melanin # AFRICA "" This is a story shared with me by one of my friends from Sankofa. This is why the Caucasians is always at war with our black skin because they know our melanin is our defense against all that they throw at us. This proves yet again that the black man is indestructible, our bodies are made of the same substances that make up this Earth because we are owners of this universe they will never wipe us off, history has already proved that.
Do you think this could be a step to finding the treatment or vaccine for this virus? "
INSIGHT-Blood-pressure drugs are in the crosshairs of COVID-19 research. 	"Scientists are baffled by how the coronavirus attacks the body - killing many patients while barely affecting others.
But some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure. Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable - and what patients should do about it - have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs.
Researchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart. They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it. Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.
The drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions. In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci - the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert - cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus.
Efforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies.
""There are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,"" said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore. ""This is one of the most important clinical questions.""
An estimated 100 million U.S. residents suffer from high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. About four-fifths of them need to take prescription drugs to control it, according to the CDC. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely prescribed to patients with congestive heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease. The drugs account for billions of dollars in prescription sales worldwide.
The absence of clear answers on how the drugs impact COVID-19 patients has sparked rampant speculation in correspondence and editorials posted on medical journal websites and those where scientists share unreviewed, pre-publication study drafts.
Many patients are agonizing over whether their medicines will help or hurt them. Doris Kertzner, 88, of Redding, Conn., said she has carefully followed experts' guidelines for preventing infection and keeps her distance from others in her retirement community. Now she has a new worry: She takes losartan, an ARB, and can't decide whether to stop.
Dropping the medicine ""presents its own problems"" in dealing with her high blood pressure.
""It's gotten very complicated,"" she said.
Dr Carlos M. Ferrario - a researcher at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and co-author of widely cited studies on ACE inhibitors - understands patients' plight.
""There is a lot of paranoia and a lot of speculation with very little fundamental, convincing information,"" he said.
The National Institutes of Health in the United States has put out a call seeking proposals for studies into the issue. An independent consortium of researchers has launched a global study to analyze health records for thousands of COVID-19 patients in the United States, Europe and Asia. That project is part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, an open-source research platform that enables large-scale studies.
Dr Marc Suchard - a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles who is leading the study - said that it aims to determine whether the medicines make infections more likely or more severe - or, by contrast, whether they help protect against the virus. Suchard said he expects a preliminary report within two weeks.
MORE TARGETS FOR THE VIRUS
There is evidence that the drugs may increase the presence of an enzyme - ACE2 - that produces hormones that lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels. That's normally a good thing. But the coronavirus also targets ACE2 and has developed spikes that can latch on to the enzyme and penetrate cells, researchers have found. So more enzymes provide more targets for the virus, potentially increasing the chance of infection or making it more severe.
Other evidence, however, suggests the infection's interference with ACE2 may lead to higher levels of a hormone that causes inflammation, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a dangerous build-up of fluid in the lungs. In that case, ARBs may be beneficial because they block some of the hormone's damaging effects.
Novartis International AG and Sanofi SA are among the major drugmakers selling ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
Sanofi spokesman Nicolas Kressmann said that patients should consult their doctors on whether to continue taking the drugs but that the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19 through its own assessment of available scientific data.
The company reviewed several recent studies from China that came to conflicting conclusions about whether COVID-19 patients with hypertension fare worse than other patients, he said.
Novartis has not issued any guidance to clinicians or patients and defers to scientists studying the issue, said spokesman Eric Althoff.
Researchers and doctors generally agree that people with severe hypertension or heart failure should keep taking the drugs because of the high risks of stopping. The debate centers on how to advise the many patients with milder conditions who take the drugs. Two camps have emerged - one calling for no action unless the drugs are proven dangerous, the other for some limits on their use until they are proven safe.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at University of Oxford in England has recommended that clinicians consider withdrawing the medicines in patients with mild hypertension if they are in a high risk group, such as medical workers - and replacing them with alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs.
The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) took the opposite tack, highlighting the drugs' potential in fighting coronavirus and recommending patients continue taking the drugs until more about the risks is known. Several of the scientists who co-authored it had done extensive, industry-supported research on antihypertensive drugs.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Dr Kevin Kavanagh, founder of Health Watch USA, a patient advocacy organization, questioned whether scientists who are funded by the drug industry should be advising clinicians, given the high stakes.
""You need to consider stepping back, and let others without a conflict of interest try to make a call,"" Kavanagh said.
His organization recommends that doctors temporarily avoid putting new patients on the drugs and warn those currently on them to take extreme precautions to avoid virus exposure.
Dr Scott David Solomon, a co-author of the NEJM article, conducts industry-financed research but said it has no influence on his position.
""Not only is there no compelling evidence that we should be discontinuing those medications, but there's reason to think that doing so might actually cause harm,"" said Solomon, who is the director of noninvasive cardiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
The lack of consensus leaves doctors to navigate the issue patient by patient. Alexander, of Johns Hopkins, is trying to strike a balance in his own practice. Patients with more severe blood-pressure problems may need to keep taking the medicines, he said, while patients with milder or newly diagnosed cases could instead take one of the ""literally dozens"" of alternative hypertension treatments.
""Rest assured,"" he said, ""there are dozens of scientific teams working feverishly to put this question to bed."""

Only 2 countries make those kind of bio weapons according to many of the reports published in the past.

“Chinese military news network Xilu claimed the virus was engineered by the United States, which is strangely at odds with what Chinese health authorities have said.”
For a biological weapon to be effective one must first design the weapon and then the antidote thus the weapon is a weapon against one self without the antidote.
You must first design the biological weapon and at at the same time design the antidote. Otherwise it kills your enemy and yourself. If this is a designed biological weapon it escaped from a military lab in error as there is no available cure for the disease at present. This may be a normal and severe pathogen as we have had in the past.
I doubt this.
This may be a biological weapon or not. I find it most strange that this particular virus is very contagious prior to symptoms. This makes it perfect as a biological weapon. 8 posted on 02/05/2020 9:39:48 PM PST by cpdiii ( canecutter, deckhand, roughneck, geologist, pilot, pharmacist THE CONSTITUTION IS WORTH DYING FOR) To: Black Agnes

Cure for Corona Virus Found. 	"CoronaVirus: Russia to Restrict Foreign Arrivals From China – Deputy PM
While addressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, he stated that “All things considered, the epidemic can be contained, controlled and treated. The Chinese nation has gone through great winds and waves and overcome countless difficulties.
The 1000 bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan, which was built in 9 days and is in full operation today, speaks volumes.” "
Corona Virus. 	"Last month as the corona virus began to spread, I could hear the rumblings. All this wave of ‘hysteria’; whether it was through news sources or people just freaking out.
Yes, many things are upsetting about the virus. Take for example, the limitation one has to go outside and enjoy a sunny day at the park. Or go to a restaurant for one’s favourite food. It is an inconvenience, but as I was telling a colleague, “I rather you be bored, than infected!” dogonews.com
Another factor, the illness is easily transmittable; but one thing is important to recognize–a person has a chance of getting it between 0.021 to 0.025%; which means a person has 99.98% chance of recovery. That in itself is a positive inside a country of 1.4 billion people. That is why I love to follow the facts and numbers. Numbers don’t lie! Furthermore, I enjoy following the science. Better to follow the facts than become one of those in the desperation of hearsay and the rumour mill.
Important to consider, the respect for life and lives the virus has taken. Don’t risk it by being selfish, going outside when there is no need. You could get infected. If that is not a problem for you when solo, then fine, but please consider those around you. Follow the experts’ suggestions, they know better and these are implemented for a reason. Stay away from crowded areas, wear a mask (Replace it every four to eight hours and try whenever possible to wear an N-95 mask or any mask for that matter), wash your hands constantly, basically practice good hygiene, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. Practical advice. Then why take unnecessary risks to try and ‘challenge’ the odds.
If you’re not sure which advice to follow. Because the internet does have fake news and charlatans out there trying to provoke fear and havoc. My teachers in school taught me always to do research on three reliable/credible news sources and compare. In times like these it is important to use common sense and not desperation.
There are many things to be thankful for…
Reason number one: we are alive and kicking. This single statement gives us hope for today, possibly tomorrow and thereafter.
Reason number two: this is not the end of the world. As some people would like to believe, you know, like those who carry posters saying, “The end is nay!” or believe in Nostradamus . Well ladies and gents, it is not! Don’t overreact.
Reason number three: stay positive. Getting down and out depressed won’t help you or anybody around you. Being sad or desperate like the virus is contagious. Avoid it. Therefore, stay calm! Stay positive by reading your favourite book, watching your favourite series, doing your favourite exercise. Even when you have ‘cabin fever’, avoid it by playing card games, keeping distracted or walking from room to room for distraction. Meditate when you feel desperate, like when you want to scream or cry. Only do the latter as a release and once it doesn’t disturb others. We all have our days, but there are more positives in life than negatives. Remember that!
Reason number four: sleep eight-and-half hours. Sleep will help improve your mood. Lack of it will make any person irritable and unhappy. Too much of it, might get you depressed.
Reason number five: try to build a routine to help improve your health and feelings about the situation. If you have food around, internet, you’re staying communicated, there’s a roof over your head, a warm bed to sleep in–hey, you’re luckier than 70% of the people around the world who don’t have that and live in poverty.
To conclude, there are things about the virus and how it was handled since its conception we may not agree with. There is no time for that, there is the present. This is a time for unity-solidarity and to look at the bright side, how it has been contained or quarantined to avoid further spreading. With this in mind, chin-up!
Humanity has the single greatest capacity in bouncing back. From this we surely will!"
Cecil College transitions programs due to COVID-19 . 	"Like many organizations, the COVID-19 virus hit Cecil College hard — and forced a change in how the school was delivering its in-person instruction.
Luckily, the school was prepared, and has used the shutdown caused by the virus to not only continue its instructional program, but also to generate new ideas for the future.
The college already had an online learning management system, according to Vice-President of Academic Programs Dr. Christy Dryer. This allowed the school to make the necessary transition to a completely distance learning concept at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown.
Online instruction
The school uses an online learning portal called Blackboard, common at many higher learning institutes. Dryer said the program provides a context for every course at the college, and that the software has been in place for several years.
One of the programs in Blackboard is Collaborate, which is a virtual classroom that professors and students can use to replicate an in-person classroom environment. Other programs include Respondus, an online test monitoring system and SoftChalk, which allows professors to create online lessons that have videos, gaming and quizzes embedded in the software.
Dryer said the school also already had an online writing lab, known as OWL.
“We also put in place a professional development for online teaching course,” Dryer said.
“In order to teach online, you have to have experience online, some formal education in online teaching or they had to take the course.”
Dryer said before COVID-19 struck, many faculty members took the online course.
“We felt uniquely positioned with a lot of the pieces in place to meet this,” Dryer said, adding that in addition to the many online programs and feature the college has at its disposal, many courses already had both online and in-person offerings and many degrees were awarded for online and in-person work.
'Everything we needed was already there'
Associate Business Professor Adele Foltz said she felt very prepared to teach online in part due to the college’s PDOT class, which she described as wonderful.
She said professors had ample time to prepare to move in-person courses to an all online format as a forewarning of the impending closure occurred before the college’s spring break that ran from March 16-21. Foltz said that professors had the entire week of spring break to prepare for the change.
Foltz said in making the transition from face-to-face instruction to online teaching, she began looking at the technology she had and what she would need to transfer her classes.
“Everything we needed was already there in the Blackboard software, I just had to implement it,” she said.
Using the software
Foltz gave the Whig an online demonstration and allowed this reporter to work through the Blackboard software as a student might. During the video presentation, Foltz was standing in front of a traditional whiteboard, and she outlined how she could teach a class using the whiteboard in a similar was to an in person class.
She also noted that the Blackboard Collaborate software as a whiteboard that can be shared with the student on the student’s own computer. She noted that her students have found the whiteboard to be helpful in learning the material.
Foltz also said the additional benefit of the software is that the lessons can be recorded, giving the students the opportunity to go back and watch the video if they either missed a portion of the lesson or might have been having an issue with some of the material presented.
“It has been pretty well received by students,” she said.
Flexibility is key in online instruction
One of the most important aspects in the delivery of information online has been the ability to remain flexible, Foltz said.
Some students, due to their family situations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, have a harder time working and studying from home. Foltz said professors have had to be innovative to be able to continue to deliver the material in a way that works for all students.
“These courses include the same objectives, same rigor and same experience through Collaborate that students receive in person,” she said.
The online experience can also be tailored in many respects to mirror an in person experience, Foltz noted.
For instance, students can not only interact with the professor, they can even interact with each other during a class. During her presentation, Foltz pointed out that a student can even raise their hand by clicking an icon that looks like a person raising their hand, this sends a tone to Foltz that she can hear and then recognize the student who is answering the question. In this way, other students can hear questions being raised by their fellow students in much the same way an in person class might be conducted.
One interesting feature Foltz pointed out in the software is the ability to send polling questions or other questions to students as group during the class. She said that while the tool has been quite useful in online learning she intends to incorporate the concept when in person classes are able to resume. She said she felt that her student’s access to her is 10 times better with the software than it might have been before, even with respect to in person classes because of all of the hands-on training she is able to do with the software.
Digital access remains an issue
The only complaints Dryer said the school has heard from students is that some students have limited access or limited wifi capabilities.
Also, some students have had difficulties initially using the technology. Dryer said health care students' normal curriculum would have them working with patients, rather than doing simulations online.
As for the technical issues, the college has been working closely with students to resolve connectivity issues as well as helping students who have had problems learning to use the technology.
“I think overall what I am hearing from our students is they are pleasantly surprised and staying engaged,” Dryer said.
Dryer said that while it is too early to know specifics relating to how the college might be able to use lessons learned during the COVID-19 shutdown for the future she did say that school officials are learning in a much more expeditious way than they might have otherwise how efficient the college can be in delivering its educational programs to its student. She said it helps expand what the college can do online going forward and helps to enhance all of the school’s programs overall.
“Once we get out of [the shutdown], there will be some programming that changes and some course delivery models that change permanently,” she said.

Fassster: ECQ, health system help slow Covid-19 spread. 	"Residents present their IDs at a checkpoint in Metro Manila during the extended community quarantine. Scientific data showed that the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) and increase in health system capacity helped prevent the spread of Covid-19.
“If there is no ECQ, Covid-19 cases will spread fast and it will have a high peak,” said Dr. Ma. Regina Justina E. Estuar, project leader of Fassster, or the Feasibility Analysis of Syndromic Surveillance using Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Modeler for Early Detection of Diseases, at a recent virtual news conference.
Data from Fassster were the bases of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) in recommending to Malacañang the possible actions to control the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
President Duterte placed Luzon under ECQ until April 30, from the original April 14, owing to the increasing incidence of Covid-19 infections.
On Friday Malacañang ordered the extension of ECQ in selected areas, including Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and other high-risk provinces in Luzon until May 15.
A general community quarantine (GCQ) will be enforced in low-risk and moderate-risk areas for the same period.
As of Friday, the country has a total of recorded 6,981 cases of Covid-19, with 722 recoveries and 462 fatalities.
However, besides ECQ, Estuar also emphasized the importance of the country’s health system capacity in controlling the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.
She showed a Fassster dashboard that indicated that “if ECQ was not declared, the number of confirmed cases would reach up to 2 million on June 21” in the National Capital Region alone.
“Because of ECQ, with the limited movement of people, and the increase in health system capacity, the projection of confirmed Covid-19 cases slowed down to half a million,” Estuar said in Filipino.
Showing another dashboard, Estuar said if ECQ will be lifted on April 30—and if the health system capacity is raised to 40 percent—the confirmed cases will be 12,000 only.
“It will show a relatively flat curve,” she explained.
“The base graph will have a lower number of confirmed cases if the health system capacity is at 40 percent or more,” Estuar, an Ateneo de Manila University professor, said.
Being a tool in decision-making, Estuar explained that the basis of Fassster analysis are data gathered from ECQ and the country’s health system capacity, including testing.
Data on ECQ include measures on the limited movement of people, social distancing and people’s observance of proper hygiene.
The health systems and testing capacity data involve the number of available testing kits, testing centers, trained personnel in handling testing, the number of polymerase chain reaction machines, laboratories, hospital beds and personal protective equipment for frontliners, among others.
With these sources of data, Estuar noted that there are many scenarios included in Fassster computation.
“That is the important contribution of Fassster. We don’t just say ‘We should lift ECQ, and here is the data.’ We say, ‘We lift the ECQ and we have a health capacity of 10 percent, 20 percent or 30 percent.’ These are the big concerns in the increase or lowering of projection. We consider various scenarios and cases,” she emphasized.
The data are gathered daily from the Department of Health Epidemiology Bureau and undergo data cleaning, where they are verified and validated, said Dr. Raymond Sarmiento of Fassster said in another virtual news conference.
Science Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara agreed that based on Fassster model, the peak of possible Covid-19 cases is decreasing.
“Before, our testing capacity is low, so the peak is high,” she said.
Guevara noted that since Fassster started working on Covid-19 early this year, it has “registered 96 percent to 98 percent accuracy.”
“So one could trust its data,” Guevara told the BusinessMirror in a phone interview in mixed Filipino.
Science Secretary Fortunato de la Peña said Health Secretary Francisco Duque were “impressed” with the performance of the Fassster model and “praised” it.
The trend points to the lowering of the number of deaths and the increasing number of recovering patients, de la Peña told the BusinessMirror in a phone interview.
De la Peña agreed that “the testing capacity—including the ability to have those [Covid-19] infected tested and the ability of the health-care system, the facilities, [the number and capacity of] health-care workers—have big a factor” in the lowering number of infected cases.
Fassster was established in 2016 as an instrument in recording, monitor and assess the cases of illnesses that could become an epidemic or pandemic. Its original targeted diseases are dengue, typhoid fever and measles.
The 30-man team is funded by Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development with P19 million for five years.
Estuar said she feels Fassster “is here to stay,” especially now that the local government units and other stakeholders have realized the importance of developing “good science” in disease projection."

Study: Restaurant's air conditioning linked to spreading COVID-19. 	"Researchers in China believe air conditioning inside a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, may have played a part in spreading COVID-19 from one person, who wasn't feeling sick, to nine others.
The researchers detailed their findings in a paper set to be published in July's issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases , a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The study highlights some of the challenges that businesses might face when they try to reopen once the curve has flattened.
Researchers described how one family, dubbed ""Family A"" in the study, traveled from Wuhan, China, and had lunch at a windowless five-story restaurant in Guangzhou on January 24. Later in the day, one family member started to feel sick and went to the hospital. They tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Within two weeks, nine other people, including four more members of ""Family A,"" and five people from two other tables had also tested positive for COVID-19.
It's important to note that of the 83 customers at the restaurant on the same floor that same day, 73 of them did not get sick. The eight employees working on the same floor also didn't get sick.
The researchers concluded the members of ""Family A"" could have been infected outside of the restaurant by their relative who showed symptoms later in the day. But for the other five people at nearby tables, the restaurant appears to be where they were infected.
The researchers believe droplets from the first person to show symptoms in ""Family A"" were likely blown by the air conditioning unit toward ""Family B,"" then bounced off the wall, back in the direction of the third family. No one else besides individuals sitting in the path of the AC unit became sick.
Sketch showing arrangement of restaurant tables and air conditioning airflow at site of outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease, Guangzhou, China, 2020. Red circles indicate seating of future case-patients; yellow-filled red circle indicates index case-patient. CDC Since the coronavirus wasn't too widespread beyond Wuhan at the time of this incident, public health officials were able to track where individuals contacted it. The other 73 restaurant-goers were quarantined for 14 days and never developed symptoms, researchers explained.
""From our examination of the potential routes of transmission, we concluded that the most likely cause of this outbreak was droplet transmission,"" the researchers wrote. ""We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow."""
Nicotine to fight Covid-19 – study says smokers have reduced. 	"Nicotine to fight Covid-19 – study says smokers have reduced risk of catching coronavirus 8 hours ago )
Can it really be that smoking tobacco, inhaling all that nicotine, reduces the risk of catching Covdi-19? Can smoking tobacco prevent really you from getting this hideous respiratory disease? A French suggests it’s true. Maybe.
A team at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus. Of the 350 ill enough to have been to warrant a prolonged stay in hospital – median age: 65 – just 4.4% were regular smokers. For those released home – median age: 44 – 5.3% smoked. But around 25% of French people are smokers. So either those with Covid-19 are liars – you told the insurance company you don’t smoke, right? – or maybe smoking is good for you?
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of March said that only 12.6% of 1,000 patients were smokers, a figure that was significantly lower than expected. Some 28% of people in China are smokers.
French neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux thinks nicotine might stop the virus from reaching cells in the body preventing its spread. Nicotine may also lessen the overreaction of the body’s immune system that has been found in the most severe cases of Covid-19 infection. To test the theory, frontline health workers, and hospital patients with the Covid-19 virus will be slapped with nicotine patches.
“Our cross-sectional study strongly suggests that those who smoke every day are much less likely to develop a symptomatic or severe infection with Sars-CoV-2 compared with the general population,” say the Pitié-Salpêtrière researchers. “The effect is significant. It divides the risk by five for ambulatory patients and by four for those admitted to hospital. We rarely see this in medicine.”"

For Corona insurance, check the small print. 	"For Corona insurance, check the small print For Corona insurance, check the small print 0 0 0 Jitendra Joshi - Companies and tourists out of pocket from the global disruption caused by the virus epidemic in China risk meeting a cold shoulder from insurers, industry experts warn.Basic travel insurance policies are unlikely to cover epidemics. Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs.For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London.""The devil really is in the details because business interruption policies, contingency policies, can cover communicable diseases. However, policy language will quite often exclude this type of disease,"" she told AFP.It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus spreading out of China, whose death toll has now surpassed that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-03.The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said.But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities.‘Very close attention’As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be ""paying very close attention to this"", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said.He cautioned individuals and companies: ""If someone travels [to China] against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.""The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers.For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30-50 billion.But China's economy accounted for 5% of global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data.More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away.‘Urgent alert’Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for ""travel disruption"" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans.""We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,"" an Aviva spokeswoman said.Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer.The company said the outbreak was ""clearly a very urgent alert"" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied.For airlines and other companies in the firing line, communicable diseases will typically only be covered if they have taken out specialist coverage.But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return.""Traditional insurance can't cover everything and non-traditional insurance will tend to carry a significant cost and require a thorough process to determine what an individual company needs,"" Franks at Marsh said.""It will be a very bespoke product."""
Premier Dwight Ball says new COVID-19 projection m. 	"Premier Dwight Ball says new COVID-19 projection models are coming Monday. (Government of Newfoundland and Labrador ) Newfoundland and Labrador has reached one week without any new reported cases of COVID-19.
As of Friday the total number of cases in the province remains at 256, with 207 people having recovered from the virus.
Five people are in hospital — 22 people have been hospitalized over the course of the pandemic — with two in intensive care. In total, 7,134 people tested have been tested, 232 in the last 24 hours.
""The dedication you have shown to this is incredible,"" said Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, at Friday's daily coronavirus update. ""As the weekend approaches please continue to follow the public health measures in place.""
Watch the full April 24 update:
As the province marked seven full days without locating new cases of the highly infectious disease, Fitzgerald issued another health order. Effective Monday at noon, employers who bring in workers from out of the country will be required to provide a 14-day isolation plan for those workers upon entering the province.
""This will help us to detect, trace and prevent the spread of imported cases of COVID-19 efficiently and effectively,"" Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald reminded anyone wondering if it's safe to visit friends that while there has been a week of no new reported cases, COVID-19 has a 14-day incubation period and can still be spread by people who are presymptomatic or who may have very mild symptoms.
The safest bet, she said, is to remain in your bubble, and if that's not possible then to wear a non-medical mask.
Premier Dwight Ball said the province's new COVID-19 projection models will be released Monday. The government panel will once again be joined by Dr. Proton Rahman, lead of the province's analytics team and a professor of medicine and a clinical researcher at Memorial University's medical school.
As a few other provinces begin to roll out plans to relax some of their health restrictions, Ball said each province is at a different stage of readiness, and Newfoundland and Labrador will discuss its plan only after reviewing Rahman's models on Monday and after a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday night.
Ball said his priorities for Friday's meeting are tight border control, COVID-19 testing capacity and protective equipment for front-line health staff when hospitals reopen to elective procedures.
""Just by the very nature of this COVID environment we'll have a greater demand on protective equipment,"" he said. ""Some of the private sector will have to reach into the pool of protective equipment, too, for them to safely conduct their businesses.""
Health Minister John Haggie said it's crucial that any plan to begin lifting restrictions is done in phases, to allow the government time to assess any effects of relaxing restrictions.
""There's no playbook for this, so we have to look at our own context and our own way of life,"" Haggie said.
Haggie said it will be a balancing act between how many hospital beds are needed to be kept free in case of a recurrence of the virus, and how many will be needed for planned procedures.
""There will be a step, then we'll stop and analyze, and then we'll see what happens to the cases. If we're good we'll go to the next step,"" he said.
""If at some point we find ourselves in a situation where numbers start to creep up we will have to go backwards. And that is not a failure.""
Misinformation Haggie issued a warning about misinformation circulating online about potential cures for COVID-19.
""When you hear about people suggesting drinking bleach to deal with COVID-19, there's absolutely no justification for this at all,"" he said.
""It is reprehensible. It beggars belief that anyone would do that.""
On Thursday President Donald Trump suggested that scientists should investigate whether putting light or disinfectant into the bodies of infected patients would help combat COVID-19. That resulted in doctors and health experts from around the world urging people not to inject disinfectant into their bodies.
On Friday evening Newfoundland and Labrador's health department issued its own news statement telling the public not to consume or inject cleaning products for purposes of treating COVID-19.
""There has been recent speculation and social media activity about whether certain cleaning products may be used as an appropriate treatment for COVID-19. This claim is false and poses a serious and dangerous risk to people,"" the release from the department said.
""If consumed or injected into the human body, there is a risk of poisoning and in some cases, death.""
Easter window Potential spread of the virus during Easter weekend, two weeks ago, was a concern for public health officials, but on Friday Haggie said he was happy to announce that the provincial government's warnings against mass gatherings appeared to have worked.
""We are now 14 days out from Good Friday, and about 11 days out from Easter Sunday,"" he said. ""It has obviously paid dividends, and the distancing has been key.""
Daily briefings will be suspended over the weekend with new coronavirus numbers being released through government news releases on Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. Ball said government officials will be made available if there is an unprecedented development over the weekend.
The government of Newfoundland and Labrador requires all travellers to fill out a mandatory declaration form upon arriving in the province:"

Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism. 	"I went home and wiped every item I had bought. And then I thought, ""You bl**dy fool, Zulfikar! You bl**dy racist fool!""

That poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth.
Corkscrew of fear and loathing
The current case of coronavirus is a little complicated.
To start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of ""unknown unknowns,"" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia.
That U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people ""based on the perception "" that they are ""outsiders."" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine ""plane loads"" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions.
As with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired.
As far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers
But then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need?
We in the ""West"" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there — whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely.
And it's happened before
The trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that ""normal reactions"" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and … wait for it … xenophobia.
But is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of ""normalizing racism"" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis).
Only I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on.
After all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about "" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination ."" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about "" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,"" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs.
And those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus
Avoidance psychology
But these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew — they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves.
In 2004, a paper about the "" psychology behind the masks "" referred to ""two diseases looming"" — one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about ""panic-stricken people"" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia.
None of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true . Watch video 01:07"
Kash Doll makes a racist anti-asian joke about the Corona Virus. 	 Fair enough, it is definitely more transmissible since people haven't had a chance to develop immunities.I'm kind of ambivalent about the reported death rate. Because so many people are not officially diagnosed/counted, the death rate is potentially a lot less. People with worse cases are more likely to show up to the doctor/hospital and be counted and die. People with milder symptoms might mistake it for a bad cold/flu and be fine afterwards and never counted. Of course, this could go the other way, but I think that people going to doctor in the worst case is more likely than staying home. Risk of dying outside of China is less than 1%. I imagine a lot of the problem in China is/was the information shutdown, intense population density, and overwhelmed/unprepared health systems.I just feel like people overreact to a danger that isn't likely to affect them while ignoring more present, more pressing dangers. 
The BIG impact of Coronavirus – The changes Covid-19 will force on to the business of Bollywood and a possible view of the future – Part 2. 	"The on-going lockdown due to the Coronavirus outbreak has affected all industries across the globe. But entertainment is one of the industries that has got majorly impacted, arguably like never before. In most places, as cases increased, cinema halls were the first ones to shut and since it comes under the non-essential category, once the lockdown will be lifted, it’ll be the last ones to start operations. Shootings too came to a halt and also other filmmaking work like post-production, casting etc. As a result, the losses faced by the industry are insurmountable. Some of the important voices have already made it clear that things won’t be the same again in a lot of respects. Brace for a ‘new normal’ is what they say.
Fears of increase in clashes at the box office
Taking the 2009 scenario once again in focus, it was seen at that point how a lot of films scrambled to come in cinemas, resulting in several clashes. The fear is that post-lockdown future will also see a repeat of that phenomenon. Taran Adarsh fears, “I foresee a very chaotic scenario. Not just Hindi, but Hollywood films, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi film etc would also be releasing. As far as Hindi films are concerned, I guess that the makers of big films would chalk out dates and discuss amicably.” Manoj Desai minces no words as he says, “ Agar producer aur distributor ke paas dimaag hai, toh saath mein nahi aana chahiye . They should space out the releases.” Shibashish Sarkar too hopes there’s no conflict over release dates, “I hope that everybody would be sensible and make a space for each other. Everybody hopefully will sacrifice and adapt to each other’s requirements.”
Akshaye Rathi comprehensively elaborates, “In this scenario, the entire value chain will have to work as one unit. No producer or exhibitor can afford any cannibalization of revenues. Before the theatres open, entities like IMPPA, Producer’s Guild, MPA etc will have to sit and work around in ensuring that clashes are minimized and nobody gets into these stupid ego wars of clashing with another film and trying to arm-twist exhibitors. It has to be a scenario where every tent pole film has to be given the maximum scope of generating revenue and every cinema in the country that runs that film should be given the maximum chance to monetize it best. So associations should ensure that every tent pole release should come 2 weeks apart from each other. The smaller films can come together as they can be accommodated simultaneously. So, a Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai coming with a Laxmmi Bomb is not an advisable scenario because we need to milk Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai to the maximum and then we also need to milk Laxmmi Bomb to the optimum! Even 10% cannibalization by one movie into the other can prove detrimental in this condition.”
While the single-screens and trade fear that clashes might be inevitable, the multiplex sector on the other hand doesn’t feel threatened over this issue. Kamal Gianchandani says, “In any case, it’s become a norm to release multiple films on a holiday. But compared to 2009, now we have more capacity. The number of screens has grown manifold. So accommodating more films in a particular week is not a problem. Two big films have been releasing regularly. Even this Eid, Akshay Kumar’s Laxmmi Bomb and Salman Khan’s Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai were supposed to arrive on the same day and that too with Fast & Furious 9! Even in Tamil and Telugu, there would have been some clashes. So release of multiple films, across languages, on a big holiday is already a norm. We don’t think that the situation will get any worse as there are enough screens to accommodate multiple movies.”
While big films might still survive in the clash of the titans, it is the smaller films that can get crushed. Producer Anand Pandit explains, “I worry for the smaller projects and smaller production houses. Success in this industry depends a lot on keeping the lid on budgets and getting the maximum out of the investment. There may be some who may have borrowed, some who may have sold assets. There will be others who may have worked tirelessly for the past several months even a year, possibly without making any money, waiting for that big payday. New projects will take time to be greenlit. Now they are all stuck. The uncertainty is quite daunting to put it mildly.”
OTT to come to the rescue for smaller films?
Recently, Bamfaad , the launch vehicle of Paresh Rawal’s son Aditya, got a direct release on the OTT portal Zee5 over fears that it might not find enough screens later on. So will more small films skip theatrical release and opt for OTT? Taran Adarsh says, “There’s a possibility that some small films might directly come on OTT. If you release your film on the web directly, then you won’t earn from theatrical. At the same time, for how long can the small films hold on? In Hollywood, they can hold on for a longer time but what about our producers?”
Girish Johar makes a valid point, “Smaller producers who have made films for less than say Rs. 10 crore, they’ll not be able to sustain the delay as they are burdened with the rising costs. So they might opt for distress sale of their film to the OTT platforms. Toh unko thodi bahut maar padegi hi padegi . But to each, its own. If a producer feels that putting his film directly on OTT will mitigate his expenses, then why not? Having said that, I feel that India is a traditionally film going market. The validation that one gets of a film being hit or flop at the box office is something that every producer, director, actor, writer etc wants.”
Akshaye Rathi too agrees as he says, “It’ll be a case-to-case scenario. A lot of filmmakers realize the premium value that a theatrical run brings to it. When cinemas open up, I believe that the producers will have way more lucrative benefits of going for a theatrical release. I can’t say what those benefits would be because that would be formulated and regulated. But I can tell you one thing for sure is that, theatres will do whatever it takes to support producers and vice versa.”
Shibashish Sarkar too thinks in the same wavelength, “Disney has decided to take Artemis Fowl straight to digital, on Disney+. Disney CEO Bob Iger has admitted that some of their other films might also release on the internet but they’ll hold some of their films for theatrical release. Same goes for Universal Studios. They released Trolls World Tour directly on OTT. But they’ll release some of their big-ticket movies on the big screen first. We are content makers and for us, some films might seem fit for OTT while some would be ideal for theatrical release. It depends on the producers to take a call. If a few films jump the theatrical release and are streamed digitally, then that’s fair enough. But there are some films that are made for the big screen and community experience. And these films will be held until theatrical opens up. If you ask me, all our films have been reserved for theatrical.”
Amod Mehra however comes up with an unconventional point of view on this topic, “The question is not whether the filmmakers want to give their small films on OTT. The question is whether OTT platforms are interested in buying these films. Why would they pay these filmmakers when there’s no shortage of content for them? The platforms will be desperate for these films only when there’s a dearth of content. Also, these portals are more interested in web series rather than films. Also, only films with bigger stars are consumed most of the times.”
At present, every filmmaker signs a contract with multiplex chains whereby they agree that they’ll release their on the OTT only 8 weeks after release. Is there a possibility that this gap might be reduced? Kamal Gianchandani makes it clear that he’s not expecting any change. But Shibashish Sarkar tells, “It will be a discussion for the future. 6 or 9 months down the line, we’ll have to see how theatrical or OTT models are working. And it’s not cast in stone that a film can come on OTT only after 8 weeks. It was followed at a certain point of time and it’s only in the future that we can figure out whether or not there will be a discussion on this subject. Right now, the focus is only to start the life again”
Change in film budgets; pay-cut for actors on the anvil?
The pandemic has led to shootings getting disrupted like never before. In such a scenario, there’s a possibility of budgets being redrawn and an increase in the cost of the films under production due to increased cost of financing. And this might lead to actors taking a pay cut or opting for profit sharing. Taran Adarsh explains, “Everyone will have to pitch in. Those days are gone when stars would adamantly say that they won’t reduce their price. I am sure things are going to undergo a drastic change.” Amod Mehra says, “All films will have to rework on their subject, number of days of shooting etc. It’ll be different for each though and one can’t generalize.”
Girish Johar explains, “Even South has started to mitigate its losses by dubbing their films in Hindi and other languages and releasing in cinemas. Recently, Allu Arjun announced that his new film Pushpa will also release in Hindi. At the end of the day, creating a noise also has a value. Meaning, you’ll have to spend a lot on P&A in order to stand out. And this will make the scenario riskier for the producers. The actors’ fees and those of director, especially if they are reputed, form large components of the budget. So their pay is a key component that has to be reduced so that everyone is able to breathe easy and comfortably tide over this difficult time”
Shibashish Sarkar meanwhile, gives a detailed reply, “We can say that only when the new normalcy kicks in. We are probably looking at a situation that the domestic theatrical business will be less than what it was in a normal situation. Maybe, the collections can even be more than before! After all, people are all bored sitting at home and wanting to go out like before. Even in the past, this has happened many times when after a catastrophe or recession, the footfalls have increased manifold. But assuming that the situation is not favourable in terms of revenue expectation, then I believe all talents, HODs, technicians etc will have to opt for a pay cut. Why just actors? The producer will have to do everything to make the ends meet. And for that, everyone will have to take a cut in their profit margins. But I reiterate, these discussions will open up only at a later date because right now, we don’t even know how things are going to pan out.”
Question mark on foreign shoots
With the situation being much more alarming internationally, can we expect less foreign shoots in our films? Anand Pandit says, “Shoots will need to be rescheduled. New dates will need to be obtained. Actors will need to juggle their dairies. New locations will need to be recced keeping in mind travel restrictions. A lot of shoots are planned abroad keeping in mind the local subsidy available. Now that may or may not be available or even be an option. So the budgets will need to be reworked. More importantly, we would need to start thinking of the safety of the entire unit while choosing foreign location. Accordingly, some scripts will need to be tweaked and altered a bit. Some producers may even need to reshoot certain portions of their films.”
Girish Johar agrees, “In India, the pandemic is very much in control and we are pretty much at ease, as compared to other parts of the world. The government’s strict measures have ensured that it has not caused widespread panic. But the situation is worse in USA and many parts of Europe. They will take much longer to come to normalcy. So if shoots resume say in July, I doubt any producer will decide to go to UK to shoot in August to take advantage of the rebate. Going there might be safe but filmmakers would rather not take the risk and instead shoot in India itself.”
Shibashish Sarkar however makes a contrary observation, “In terms of timeline when shooting may start, we need to wait and evaluate options. All the countries or all the states have been coping differently. We definitely need to wait till the health crisis is over and lockdown opens up, especially the travel restrictions. There are some countries or states which will reach normalcy stage sooner than other. So there will be countries which will bounce back before India. Similarly there will be countries which will take more time. For instance, till now, the disease has not fortunately struck so badly in African countries. We need to see whether it remains controlled in future. Also, in some of the South East Asian countries, their peak was probably before it was in India. It’s likely that restrictions there will be eased out before. So, in some nations, permissions for shooting will be granted even before India. If someone wants to shoot in those countries, if the story allows, and if travel restrictions eased out, it can be possible that probably shoot can start earlier in some other countries. That might not be the case for European or North American nations. The same might hold true even at a state level within the country. Some states probably will come back to normalcy before others. However, whether the shoot takes place in our country or abroad, we’ll all have to gear up for a new reality. The units will be smaller, the members will have to follow much more social hygiene conducts, wear masks, use sanitizers, practice social distancing etc”
Rise in social distancing = fall in intimate scenes?
Taran Adarsh exults, “The two words ‘social distancing’ dimaag mein chhap chuke hai . This entire habit of staying away from people will take time to go away.” In this regard, even shooting sets will have to practice safety measures strictly. So will that led to reduction of kissing or any form of intimacy on screen? Girish Johar laughs and disagrees, “I don’t think kissing scenes will reduce or that there would be only zoomed out scenes!” In a lighter vein he says, “Or it might be like Amitabh Bachchan’s short film Family .”
An amused Kamal Gianchandani says, “I don’t think so. From 100% social distancing to 0% social distancing will take time. There’ll be a transition. But at some time, we’ll get back to normal. At some point, there’ll be a vaccine and thus, the disease will be eradicated totally. But even in the transition phase, I am sure that the necessary precautions can be taken. And if there’s a requirement to show intimate scenes, I am sure it’ll be possible to do so.”
Amod Mehra says, “I don’t think the actors will be ready to do a kissing scene unless the script drastically demands it. This used to happen with pornographic films also. Sunny Leone has said it in many interviews that she had to show a medical certificate to prove that she doesn’t have a STD. So similarly, actors will need a certificate that states that he/she is fit and doesn’t have cough or cold”
Akshaye Rathi makes a valid observation, “I’m pretty sure nothing of that sort is going to happen and the Indian censor board will have a lot of work to do! There are so many films that are already been made. And for the ones that haven’t been made, I don’t think it makes any difference at all. Before going for that kind of shots, perhaps the actors will go through a sanitization tunnels. So I am sure such measures will be implemented. Also, by that logic, action scenes bhi nahi ho sakte na? Agar main kisi ko punch karunga, toh mere toh haath lag gaya na uss aadmi ko !” Taran Adarsh too agrees on the later part, “Why just lovemaking? Even action sequences or emotional sequences of a parent hugging a child or dramatic sequence, which demand an actor to hold someone, everything will undergo a massive change.”
Conclusion
Tough times lay ahead but the industry seems to be united like never before. No one exactly knows what the future holds but one thing is for sure – everyone is ready to co-operate to each other till things ease out. “The fact remains that the industry will need to come together as one and give each other a helping hand. We will have to be more united than ever before. Perhaps this may be a time for the industry look at their costs, fees and margins. It's not the same world anymore,” says Anand Pandit and serves well as the last word. "
Terumo BCT’s Mirasol reduces the virus causing COVID-19 below the limit of detection in plasma and platelets. 	"A study published today in peer-reviewed Vox Sanguinis shows Terumo BCT's Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to undetectable levels. Mirasol is designed to add an extra layer of safety to the blood supply. In some parts of the world, where Mirasol is approved for use, the device is used to treat convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients. [1] LAKEWOOD, CO. USA – 23 April 2020 – Today, Vox Sanguinis , a peer-reviewed medical journal, published results from a Terumo BCT study conducted in collaboration with top researchers at Colorado State University . The study examined how well the Mirasol system treated platelets and plasma against the virus causing COVID-19.
The results showed that Mirasol is effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, when high virus levels are present in human plasma and platelets.
Study Results [2] In the Terumo BCT study, the measured titer of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection in tissue culture following treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light on the Mirasol system. The mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 3.40 and ≥ 4.53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively.
Mirasol effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelets to undetectable levels. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2.
Changing World = Emerging Pathogens Pathogen reduction with Mirasol is a method to address emerging and evolving pathogens as the rate of epidemics increases, people travel more and the global climate warms.
“Mirasol adds a layer of safety to blood products by reducing the risk of transfusion transmission of both known and emerging pathogens,"" says Shawn D. Keil, Scientific Affairs, Terumo BCT, and lead author of the publication. “SARS-CoV-2 won’t be the last novel virus to emerge. Using the Mirasol PRT system is a proactive approach to protecting the foundation of healthcare, blood.”
Dr. Louis Katz, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center , Davenport, Iowa, U.S.A., said: “Once more, in the aftermath of HIV and HCV [the hepatitis C virus], we are reminded that a proactive intervention like pathogen reduction could be of value in urgent and emergent circumstances like the current pandemic.”
Pathogen Reduction and Convalescent Plasma People who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies to the disease in their blood. Some healthcare providers are using convalescent plasma for patients with severe COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus. [3] Others are considering using convalescent plasma to provide passive immunity to healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses who have been exposed to the virus but are not showing symptoms. Mirasol may add an extra layer of safety to convalescent plasma, even though there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through transfusion.
""The proactive value of pathogen reduction providing blood safety in the event of unknown pathogen outbreaks is shown in this awful COVID-19 pandemic. The riboflavin technology inactivates the SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, so it should be especially helpful in the treatment of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and to provide additional safety for standard blood products,"" Dr. Jeffrey McCullough, MD, Professor Emeritus, University of Minnesota Medical School .*
About Mirasol Using riboflavin (vitamin B2) and ultraviolet light, Mirasol is designed to reduce the pathogen load of various disease-causing agents such as viruses, parasites and bacteria in blood products before they are transfused to patients. Mirasol also inactivates white blood cells to help reduce certain transfusion reactions.
Mirasol is CE marked for platelets, plasma and whole blood and is in routine use in more than 20 countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. The system is not approved for sale in the U.S. and Canada.
There are no approved devices or therapies for specific treatment of COVID-19.

The Real Story Behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus?. 	"The Real Story Behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus? The Real Story Behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus? conspiracy theory , Crisis Alert , Health and Fitness , Opinion There is a big story circulating around about the real story behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus - COVID-19 . This story asks tons of questions and seems to point a finger at the United States for the current pandemic. Is it really true? Let's see. 16 questions on CV for US!! 1. Despite many Caucasians being in Wuhan, why did the virus appear only to attack Chinese or those with Chinese blood? At the moment we have no answer to this. Does it really attack only people with Chinese blood? Needs further proof. 2. Why was the coronavirus first reported outbreak 14 days after 300 US military personnel arrived in Wuhan for the Military World Games on October 19? The incubation period was 14 days. This is false. The first detected case of the Novel Corona Virus is on December 31, 2019. According to a CNN timeline, the first cases occur between December 12 and December 29, 2019 as per Wuhan Municipal Health. ( Source 1 | Source 2 ) As for the Military World Games, it indeed happened in Wuhan China. ( Source 1 | Source 2 ) 3. Why did Harvard collect DNA of Chinese people in China a year ago under a research project? According to an article in the New York Times, ""China Uses DNA to Trackl Its People, With the Help of American Expertise. The Chinese authorities turned to a Massachusetts company and a prominent Yale researcher as they built an enormous system of surveillance and control. So technically, China is the one collecting the DNA and not the US. ( Source ) 4. Why and how did a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML biological labs end up in China in March 2019? There is a legitimate article published on a Canadian Public News Agency telling the story of a breach in the National Microbilogy Lab (NML) in Winnipeg. A researcher with ties to China was recently escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what's being described as a possible ""policy breach."" Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and an unknown number of her students from China were removed from Canada's only level-4 lab on July 5, CBC News has learned. ( Source ) 5. Why did US withdraw or evacuate its embassy workers and staff based in Wuhan immediately after the Military Game in end Oct? There is no news regarding this. The only real evacuation happened after the outbreak of the virus. (Source) 6. Why did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Predict Up To 65 Million Deaths Via Coronavirus in Sept 2019? Coincidence? “The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. ( Source ) 7. The virus resembles virus from a rare South African bat, a cobra and other kind of sea creature. How such a virus end up in Wuhan - South African bat? According to a Research Journal, the source of the genetic sequences of the novel corona virus is 99% similar to the genetic sequences of viruses isolated from Pangolins Scientists say that the suggestion, based on genetic analysis, seems plausible — but caution that the researchers’ work is yet to be published in full. “This is an extremely interesting observation. Although we need to see more details, it does make sense as there are now some other data emerging that pangolins carry viruses that are closely related to 2019-nCoV,” says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. ( Source ) More Questions About the Novel Corona Virus Here are more questions about the 2019 Novel Corona Virus which we ought to verify or perhaps you can help us answer and verify them. 8. How did the viruses jump species barriers over 3 animals without human assistance? 9. Why the outbreaks happen after the failure of US’ sponsored attacks in HK and Xinjiang? 10. Why the outbreak happened after some virus attacked the pig and chicken farming in China? 11. Who spread and attacked the pigs in China? Report mentioned a droid was used to spray viruses on the pigs. 12. Why did US immediately start spreading rumours via its media that China stole US’ virus and accidentally leaked it in Wuhan? But the facility in Wuhan is NOT a military or development facility. 13. Why this happened in china when Only US holds the Patent For ‘An Attenuated Coronavirus’ which was Filed In 2015 And Granted In 2018? 14. Why a large number of the initial victims were not related to and never been to the wet market in Wuhan? Was it really the originator? 15. What and why did US bury biohazards containers in the US’ evacuated consulate in Wuhan? 16. Why was US’ leaders, politicians and media immediate reactions and line of questions on China when the outbreak was announced so aligned and similar? Was there already an agreement prior to the outbreak was announced? 2019 Novel Corona Virus is Due to a Chinese Lab Containment Error? Another detailed articles walks through certain events and circumstances about the virus. This is very detailed and the author itself says that this theory might be very plausible. A study published on the Lancet finds no connection to the wet food market in 13 of the initial infected. “… the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The earliest case became ill on 1 December and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. “No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace either. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Georgetown” What do you think?

Will Corona Bat Beer Virus End Alaska Cruise Ship Tours?. 	"In 2020 , it's expected that 606 cruise line sailings will carry about 1.41 million tourists to Alaska; a majority of them porting in Ketchikan first before sailing up the inside waters to destinations in Sitka and Juneau. The first ship will arrive in Ketchikan on April 25th bringing with them a crew of 910 and 2,680 passengers and if the schedule holds, Ketchikan and Alaska will have a 5th consecutive record breaking visitors.
In short, Southeast, Alaska depends on tourism. Unfortunately, there could be a wrench in the cruise ship travel industry with two cruise ships already linked directly to the corona virus--one in Japan and one in New Jersey:
61 passengers on cruise ship quarantined in Japan test positive for coronavirus :
Dozens more passengers aboard a Princess Cruises ship in Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus. As of Friday, 41 more people, including eight Americans, had been confirmed to have the potentially lethal virus, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 61.
A total of 3,700 passengers and workers, including three Americans, are quarantined on the ship, which is harbored in the port city of Yokohama. Tests are pending on one remaining group of passengers who either showed symptoms or were in contact with a man who was diagnosed with the virus after leaving the ship in Hong Kong.
NBC New York :
More than two dozen Chinese nationals who traveled aboard a cruise ship that returned to New Jersey were screened for signs of the new virus that has sicked tens of thousands in mainland China and killed more than 600. Four of the passengers on the ship were taken to a hospital out of caution.
Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis tells NBC New York that one of the four travelers who had come from China for the Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas cruise through the Caribbean had a fever on the ship. The person was given Tylenol and the fever went away.
Three others are under close observation and they were taken to University Hospital in Newark, which has negative-pressure isolation rooms, the mayor said. Gov. Phil Murphy added that the hospital was following proper infection control protocols while evaluating the travelers.
How Serious is Corona Virus?
Always, always listen to John Cusack, unfortunately, as of this writing we weren't able to contact John for his opinion on the virus. Fortunately, it seems that this virus is contained in China and while it is distrupting tourism and the economy world-wide, it most likely won't impact us in an apocalyptic way.

Meanwhile, United States has seen a record number of deaths in 24-hour span today. Over 3100 people have died of coronavirus in the US in 24 hours. The total death toll in the US is now about to touch 50,000 while the global toll has crossed 1,90,000. Total number of coronavirus cases across 180 countries has also touched new heights and crossed the 27,00,000-mark. Follow live updates on coronavirus outbreak in India and the global pandemic"
Two New York cats become first US pets to test positive for Covid-19. 	"Two cats in New York have become the first pets in the United States to test positive for the new coronavirus but there is no evidence pets can spread the virus to humans, according to US health authorities.
The cats, from separate areas of New York state, had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. It is believed that they contracted the virus from people in their households or neighborhoods, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""Animals, pets, can get infected. ... There's no evidence that the virus is transmitted from the pet to a human,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at the daily coronavirus briefing.
There are few known Covid-19 infections of pets globally. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, one cat in Hong Kong tested positive without displaying symptoms, while a cat in Belgium recovered nine days after falling ill.
Five tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York have also tested positive for Covid-19, including one tiger who never developed a cough, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, the non-profit which runs the zoo.
""Our cats were infected by a staff person who was asymptomatically infected with the virus or before that person developed symptoms,"" the WCS said on Wednesday. ""All eight cats continue to do well. They are behaving normally, eating well, and their coughing is greatly reduced.""
None of the zoo's leopards, cheetahs, puma or serval are showing any signs of illness, it added.
New York City is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, which like much of the world is taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread, but authorities indicated owners did not need to fear their pets.
""There is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States,"" the CDC said in a statement. ""Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including pets, could be affected.""
The agency recommends that owners not let their pets interact with people or other animals outside the household. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, maintaining at least six feet (1.8 meters) from other animals and people, it said.
The CDC said coronavirus infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with Covid-19. It is not recommending routine testing of animals at this juncture.
The AVMA similarly said it was not changing its basic guidance for pet owners and veterinarians, adding that any test of an animal should be performed in coordination with public health officials.
Maine-based animal health company IDEXX Laboratories Inc on Monday rolled out a Covid-19 test for pets, which it said would be available to veterinarians in North America this week and distributed internationally after that.
IDEXX said it has conducted over 5 000 tests in cats, dogs, and horses with respiratory symptoms in 17 countries and has found no positive results, suggesting pets ""generally remain uninfected, except in rare and isolated cases.""
The company developed its test specifically for use in animals and its laboratories are not approved for handling human specimens, it said.
Earlier this month a study suggested that cats can become infected with the new coronavirus but dogs appear not to be vulnerable, prompting the World Health Organization to say it will take a closer look at transmission of the virus between humans and pets.
A recent study published on the website of the journal Science found that cats and ferrets can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the scientific term for the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease in humans.
The study, based on research conducted in China in January and February, found, however, that dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks are not likely to catch the virus.
The United States has the world's largest number of coronavirus cases at over 830 000, with 47 050 deaths as of Wednesday."
Child protection organizations seeing ‘significant uptick’ in predators using COVID-19 as opportunity to exploit online. 	"The Canadian Centre for Child Protection fielded 80 priority reports to the tip line, up from about 15 on any busy weekend before the pandemic, over one weekend in mid-April In dark web forums, sexual predators are increasingly discussing the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to exploit children online as they spend more time out of school and on the internet. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection is seeing an increase in talk among predators and a spike in activity on its tip line for reporting online sexual exploitation of children, said Signy Arnason, the centre’s associate executive director .
“There’s no question that you’re seeing an uptick – a significant uptick – in chatter related to taking advantage of COVID-19,” Ms. Arnason said. “It’s really like a heyday for offenders.”

Over one weekend in mid-April, the centre fielded 80 priority reports to the tip line, up from about 15 on any busy weekend before the pandemic, she said. Still, reports to the tip line don’t capture the entire scope of the problem because many children don’t know that their images have been stored and shared, she added.
A few days later, UNICEF issued a strong warning about the heightened risk of online sexual exploitation during a lockdown. The organization is urging technology companies to improve the safety features of their platforms and asking governments to step up awareness initiatives. Reports of child sexual exploitation to tip lines across the world have increased an average of 30 per cent amid the pandemic, according to InHope, a global network of cyber tip lines, as first reported by NBC News.
Online sexual exploitation can refer to children who are abused in their homes and then have images of the abuse distributed online, as well as children who are sexually exploited through online interactions.
Predators who attempt to collect nude images or sexual videos of children on livestreaming platforms – “cappers,” they call themselves – share techniques and encouragement within communities on the dark web, according to the centre.
In a typical scenario, a capper would target a boy using a “bait” video – often showing a girl undressing – using specialized software to give the boy the impression that he is livestreaming with a female peer rather than an adult male.
The predator would then direct the boy to perform sexual acts, recording the livestream for distribution online. Some predators will extort children for money or additional sexual images by threatening to release pictures and videos they already have online or to family and friends.
“If you cant find a boy right now your catfish [bait] video either sucks or you have zero idea how to talk to teens,” commented one predator recently in a dark web forum captured by the centre. “Omegle has literally been bursting at the seams in the last 2 weeks with boys,” wrote another, referring to a popular website for anonymous chatting.

Girls are more often targeted for sexual grooming, which can involve predators complimenting them and creating the illusion of a relationship, Ms. Arnason said.
A message for all children is that they should never appear nude on webcams or livestreams, she said.
Predators can reach children on well-known apps such as TikTok and Instagram, as well as gaming interfaces such as Roblox and Discord; websites such as Omegle; and apps such as Cake and Sarahah, which have been the focus of safety alerts from the centre’s tip line, Cybertip.ca.
Sergeant Arnold Guerin, who works in the technology section of the RCMP’s National Child Exploitation Crime Centre, said his team is also tracking a rise in conversation among predators, who were “gleeful and delighted” about children having more screen time, often unsupervised.
He emphasized the importance of parents having conversations with their children about the internet and said that focusing on whether certain platforms are worse than others isn’t particularly helpful.
“What is more helpful advice is to be really involved in your child’s online community,” Sgt. Guerin said. “It’s okay to go to your kids and say, ‘Hey, I don’t know anything about Snapchat. Can you tell me what a private story is?'"" (They can only be viewed by people the Snapchat user has selected.)
Story continues below advertisement
Children should not accept social media contacts and friend requests from strangers, Sgt. Guerin said, acknowledging that this is difficult for a lot of kids who want more likes on their content.
Staff Sergeant Sharon Hanlon, manager of the Ontario Provincial Police’s Child Sexual Exploitation Unit, said a common issue is children doing stunts to get more likes, such as momentarily dropping their pants, not realizing how their images could later be used. (A spokeswoman for the Toronto Police Service, Meaghan Gray, said the force’s child exploitation unit has noticed an increase in children voluntarily posting images that could be used by an adult for exploitative purposes.)
Staff Sgt. Hanlon recommended that families download a free resource called Understanding Child Sexual Abuse , which was created by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. “An informed public is the best defence against the sexual exploitation of children,” she added.
In 2016, the centre launched Project Arachnid, a platform that automatically searches, or “crawls,” links reported to the centre’s tip line and sends notices to technology companies to remove identified child sexual abuse material. Last year, the centre received about 35,000 reports to its tip line and sent more than 1.3 million removal notifications to electronic service providers.
In early March, five countries, including the United States and Canada, released a set of 11 voluntary principles for technology companies to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse. They include calling on companies to prevent child sexual abuse material from being made available on their platforms, identify exploitation facilitated by livestreaming and introduce stronger safety mechanisms.
Though parents and guardians have an important role to play in prevention, Ms. Arnason said the notion that they can know everything their kids are doing online is “ludicrous.”

“It allows industry to get off the hook for the fact that they have not put in place the measures that are needed,” she said.
Online sexual exploitation of children can be reported to Cybertip.ca, Canada’s national tip line. Information about a child who is in immediate danger should be reported to 911.

Elizabeth Warren's oldest brother dies of covid-19. 	"Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Thursday that the eldest of her three brothers, Donald Reed Herring, had died of covid-19 in Oklahoma.
""He was charming and funny, a natural leader,"" Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement. ""What made him extra special was his smile. He had a quick, crooked smile that seemed to generate its own light - and to light up everyone around him.""
The death means that Warren is one of several top political figures whose orbits have been afflicted by the pandemic. The husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was hospitalized for treatment of covid-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes, and has recovered. Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, lost a longtime friend and adviser to the disease.
President Donald Trump's friend and donor Stanley Chera died of covid-19 earlier this month.
Herring, who was 86, tested positive for the disease in early April, according to a Warren aide, and he died Tuesday evening in Norman, Oklahoma. It is not clear how he contracted covid-19, but he had been in a rehabilitation center in early April where several others had active cases, the aide said.
""I'm grateful to the nurses and other front-line staff who took care of my brother, but it is hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say 'I love you' one more time,"" Warren said. ""And now there's no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close. I will miss my brother.""
The senator shared several photos of him on social media Thursday morning, including a black-and-white shot of Herring wearing aviator glasses and a helmet while sitting in the cockpit of a plane.
Warren has released several plans on dealing with the pandemic, including a proposal Thursday with Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., outlining a public health procedure called contact tracing.
Warren, who ended her presidential campaign last month, frequently told anecdotes at her rallies about growing up in Oklahoma with three older brothers. She was particularly proud of Herring's military service, noting in many speeches that he spent more than five years in combat in Vietnam.
""We were very lucky to get him back,"" Warren told audiences. Herring joined the Air Force at age 19 and spent his career in the military, she said.
Warren, a liberal Democrat, also liked to point out the ideological diversity of her siblings. ""I told you about my three brothers, Don Reed, John and David,"" she said last year at a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire. ""One of them is a Democrat. Think about what that means. I've got Thanksgivings just like you all.""
She often went on to say that despite their differing political philosophies, the four siblings were in agreement in many areas.
Herring retired from the military in 1973 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and started a small auto-detailing business, according to Warren's office. He is survived by his wife, Judith, his two sons, John and Jeffrey, and his three siblings."

Corona virus : Are you prepared?. 	"First post for the new year and it is on this note. But let’s make the most of it shall we?
Amidst the outbreak of the horrid Corona Virus , news agencies have been reporting daily about how this vicious virus is claiming so many lives and how rapidly it is infecting people. The point of the post is to spread awareness. So please read until the end and share it with someone you know.
I have a sister and two nieces who are abroad. They are based In Hubei, Wuhan; the city mostly affected by this virus. The city is on lock down. Nobody can enter or leave. You need a permit to drive In public. The city is literally quarantined. People are dying; falling whilst waiting to get seen to. Hospitals are packed to capacity. Healthcare workers, no no rather heros, are working around the clock to ensure they cure and see to as many people as they can. I feel like I’m writing a script to a movie.
No doubt that their safety is my biggest concern. But further to that, it is our safety. If Shanghai has declared a level 1 emergency on this (the highest level), why aren’t we seeing preventative posts here In South Africa? I mean people are constantly traveling to and from China. It kinda is no wonder though, when our government doesn’t even care much about its citizens abroad.
Latest stats What’s even more alarming is that every other continent has recorded cases of infected people except us here in Africa… One case was earlier brought to light but no confirmation on whether it was the virus or not. Are there really no records or is something being hushed? I suppose that’s a conversation for another day. But something just doesn’t add up.
The point of this post though is to spread awareness though, so let’s get back to topic.
Keep your immune systems strong. You can do that by staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, eating more fresh fruits and veggies. You can take vitamin c supplements and other multi vitamins. Excersise often and just stay healthy.
All images are courtesy of Google Another important part of this is hygiene. Sanatize all your belongings atleast twice a day. Use alcohol based hand Sanatizer. Keep it with you. If you go to gym, wipe those machines down and sanatize before and after. If you don’t have Sanatizer, you mix a cap of detol to 400mls of water and spray it over your belongings. Or even use ammonia based products such as bleach and or Domestos.
Spread this as it could help save someone’s life.
The Corona virus is said to be 10 times worse than the SARS virus and scientists estimate that it will only start dying down In May. May God keep all those abroad safe and keep their families here at home calm. Aameen

AstraZeneca's fast-rising diabetes med Farxiga jumps into the COVID-19 fray. 	"AstraZeneca's high-profile SGLT2 diabetes med Farxiga is looking at a bright future with big FDA decisions in heart failure and kidney disease right around the corner. Now, the British drugmaker is testing it as a potential coronavirus therapy, too.
AstraZeneca has launched a phase 3 trial evaluating Farxiga as a treatment for severe COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular, metabolic or kidney risk factors that increase the probability of severe complications, including organ failure, the drugmaker said Thursday.
The global, double-blind study, dubbed Dare-19, will be conducted in partnership with St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and will enroll around 900 patients at U.S. and European clinical sites.

Chinese researcher escorted from infectious disease lab amid RCMP investigation
A researcher with ties to China was recently escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what’s being described as a possible “policy breach.”

Experts issue guide on lung screening, management during COVID-19. 	"A new expert panel consensus statement published simultaneously today in the journals Radiology: Imaging Cancer, Chest and the Journal of the American College of Radiology provides guidance to clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many parts of the world, the COVID-19 public health crisis has stressed the health care system close to or even past its breaking point. Hospital resources are focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically ill. The strain on health care systems and the need to control the virus using containment and mitigation has impacted the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary exams against the risk of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings or exposing health care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including hospital personnel, to evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.
""The potential risk of exposure or transmission during routine care, as well as the diversion of resources to help combat the pandemic, has forced clinicians to make decisions about the timing of care,"" said Peter J. Mazzone, M.D., M.P.H., FCCP, director of the Lung Cancer Program and Lung Cancer Screening Program for the Cleveland Clinic Respiratory Institute. ""This document provides guidance that we hope will help with these decisions. It outlines acceptable variances from standard practice during the pandemic and provides items to consider that could influence the decisions for a given patient.""
Performing a lung cancer screening exam or the evaluation of lung nodules both carry additional risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is added risk to the patient, other patients and health care providers from exposure to the health care environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection may be influenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of benefit and harm struck by current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in health care resources, toward canceling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where
COVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more difficult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to suggest that non-urgent care be deferred.
To date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and lung nodule management programs during the pandemic. The consensus statement was developed to provide expert opinion to clinicians regarding the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with lung nodules in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance. Three project leaders and 21 panel members participated in developing the consensus statement. Their specialties included pulmonology, thoracic radiology and thoracic surgery. Twelve scenarios were developed, each with a statement requiring a vote. The voting results for all statements exceeded the threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree. Scenarios recommendations and notes are included in the report.
Consensus was unanimous for recommendations to delay baseline or repeat annual screening, and over 95% of panelists agreed to delay the evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected incidentally or by screening that have a low probability of cancer or are likely to be an indolent cancer.
Consensus was less uniform but still strong for recommendations to delay or modify the evaluation and management of patients with nodules measuring greater than 8 millimeters in average diameter.
The authors note that these recommendations are not ""one-size-fits-all"" and state that patient preferences should be considered in all of the scenarios, because individual patients are likely to differ in how they perceive the potential benefits and harms associated with delayed or modified evaluation and management.
The paper points out that due to the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible at this time to determine when it will be advisable to return to usual care practices.
""We hope these statements are helpful and provide some reassurance and direction to individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening, patients with lung nodules, and the clinicians who care for them,"" the authors conclude.
RSNA is committed to connecting radiologists and the radiology community to the most timely and useful COVID-19 information and resources. RSNA's COVID-19 Resources page houses the latest guidance, original research, image collection and more. The page will be updated on an ongoing basis."

TARLAC: Health experts in this province are now on high alert over reports that the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has reached the province.
The reports said six suspected carriers had been confined at a hospital here.
On Sunday, the patients, including Americans, Japanese and a Filipino with histories of travel to Hong Kong last January 10 to 22, with flu-like symptoms were initially brought to a hospital in Paniqui town.
Todays Plan:
Buy more rice. Not for myself rather to give the security guards to keep them from running away, or if nothing happens then well, I will have a shitload of rice.
More batteries arrived yesterday for the solar system.
Need to pick up wire, circuit breakers, and machine parts.
Got a couple sales today that should cover all the money spent yesterday.
As a side note: This is how this pandemic will spread to the US.
Guy I know. His son was in China, exchange student in college. Kid leaves cuz the flu 10 days ago. Shows no symptoms. Couple days ago, his father goes to the US for a meeting. I am not saying the kid is sick, nor the father. Let me be clear about that. But there are plenty of others, who will be in this exact same situation.

Death Toll: 724, Corona Virus, more than 34 thousand infected. 	"In just a span of 2 months, the spread of China’s New Corona Virus is massive, with death toll of 724 already and infections among more than 20 couuntries. Though local authorities did a great job in preventing further infections, the virus has now entered to at least 28 countries. Confirmed cases from day to day is rapidly increasing. Overall, there have been 34, 878 cases confirmed as of February 8, 2020. In which 34, 546 of the infections comes from mainland China. Japan, has confirmed 89 cases, 33 in Singapore, and 26 in Hong Kong. Thailand has recorded its first 25 cases of the Novel Corona Virus. South Korea with 24 cases, Taiwan also has 16. Australia and Malaysia both have 15 cases of the said virus. Germany has 14, 12 in the United States, Vietnam with 12 and Macau has 10.

Southwest Removes a Sick Passenger Because of Corona Virus Fears. 	"The coronavirus is one of the biggest news stories in the world. There is a very good reason for this. It is a massive outbreak that has already cost more than 100 people their lives. There have also been more than 4,000 cases. Therefore, precautions need to be taken to prevent the disease from spreading. Airlines need to be particularly vigilant. There was a recent case where a passenger became very ill on a Southwest Airlines flight at the Las Vegas airport. The person was showing symptoms that led employees of the airline to think he might have the flu. In addition to that, the person had recently been to China. This info prompted Southwest to ask the person to be removed from the flight.
The sick passenger was taken to a medical facility where he underwent tests to determine if he had the coronavirus . It turned out that the man was not infected. However, Southwest is being praised for the way that they handled the situation. Airlines understand that they cannot be too careful where this deadly virus is concerned. This is especially true when you consider that there are people who are constantly flying from countries where they might have come into contact with an infected person.
All airlines are creating a protocol so that staff members know what to do if a person on the plane looks like he or she has the flu. The employees of Southwest acted very quickly in this situation. It turned out to be a false alarm. However, they took the proactive approach and that was the right thing to do. It looks like it is going to be a long time until the coronavirus is contained. Therefore, more incidents of sick passengers are going to happen in the coming days and weeks. It is very important that airlines know what to do in that situation.
As of right now, the airlines are on their own as far as the the procedures they want to use regarding passengers possibly being infected. Certain airports are already conducting screenings for the virus. The FAA might get involved and require the airlines to take certain procedures to further safeguard their passengers against the possible spread of the virus. However, the FAA has remained silent for the time being. The incident today brings the outbreak more into focus. It will make people reconsider flying on a plane if they don’t need to."

Netizens have used the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus), among others, to complain about having been abused on public transport, on social media, and in the street.
The apparent increase in anti-Asian sentiment followed the central France-based newspaper Le Courier Picard using inflammatory headlines that included ""Alerte jaune"" (Yellow alert) and ""Le peril jaune?"" (Yellow peril?), the BBC reported.
The broadcaster said there have been similar reports in the United Kingdom and in other countries of an increase in anti-Asian racism.
When called out, Le Courier Picard apologized for its headlines and admitted they were examples of the ""worst Asian stereotypes"".
Lou Chengwang took to Twitter to tell his neighbors: ""I'm Chinese, but I'm not a virus! I know everyone's scared of the virus but no prejudice, please.""
And Cathy Tran used the same hashtag to describe an exchange between two men in the northeastern town of Colmar. She said she heard them say: ""Watch out, a Chinese girl is coming our way.""
On another occasion, she said, a man on a scooter told her to wear a face mask.
Another social media user said people should ""stop asking if we're dangerous if we cough while all the people around us are doing so"".
Reuters reports that customers have frequently asked Pascal Corlier, the owner of a Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, whether any of his serving staff are Chinese.
""There's a sort of unfounded psychosis setting in around the Asian community and Asian food,"" he said, while noting that his takings are about 40 percent down on where they should be.
Laetitia Chhiv, who runs an association for young people of Chinese descent, told Reuters: ""We had a student of Chinese origin in Strasbourg who was shouted at by a woman who told him not to touch the avocados she wanted to buy. That was after she asked him where he was from and whether he had the virus.""
In Toronto, Canada, concerns about rising anti-Asian sentiment prompted city councilors and Chinese community leaders to call a news conference last week in order to remind residents that people of Asian descent are no more likely to have the virus than anyone else.
French-born Sun-Lay Tan, who is of Chinese and Cambodian descent, said: ""Racism against Asians is spreading even faster than the virus. I was sitting on the metro on my way to work and the person next to me edged a few centimeters away and put his scarf over his mouth. I was shocked.""
Corlier, the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, said ""people are panicking"".
He said it is hard to hold that against them.
""But they have to take a step back... and look at the facts.""
Meanwhile, several EU nations imposed increased checks at borders on incoming Chinese visitors.
Some nations, including Italy, the United States, Australia, have even banned the arrival of visitors from China and introduced a requirement on their own citizens who have visited China to be quarantined upon their return."
Corona Virus Economics . 	"The world is a complicated place. While things often seem to be happening independently of each other, they are actually connections that we aren’t aware of or that are deliberately hidden from us. Tesla was on its way to $1000 but stopped just short. Is the financial system about to collapse or is this the best economy ever? The stock market keeps rallying, as if there won’t be anymore stock issued and you’ve got to get it while it’s still available.
Everything going on in our financial system is counter-intuited. Central banks keep pumping in the liquidity. The Fed’s temporary lending programs seem to be on their way to permanency. As long as they’re done under the guise of repo, then they’ll never have to account for it. And it’s happening over the world."
ICMR approves IIT Delhi's affordable test kits for COVID-19. 	"ICMR approves IIT Delhi's affordable test kits for COVID-19 Published on: Apr 24, 2020 07:16 IST Gaurav Macwan Register for Result Update
IIT Delhi COVID-19 Test Approved by ICMR : As per the latest update, ICMR has approved the affordable test kits for detection of novel Coronavirus which causes COVID-19. The new testing method developed by a research team at IIT Delhi will make COVID-19 testing significantly cheaper and thereby be available to more number of people. The approval to the new testing technique developed by a team of researchers from IIT Delhi was approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is leading India’s fight against the Coronavirus pandemic. IIT Delhi – First Academic Institute To Receive ICMR Approval
According to details available right now, the premier technology institute i.e. IIT Dlehi is the only academic institute so far which has received ICMR approval for a unique testing methodology for COVID-19. Earlier, a research team from the institute had announced that it had developed a new real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 aka the virus which causes COVID-19. Now, with ICMR approval in place, the institute can ramp up its development and production of the COVI0-19 real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay test kits to help India test more number of people. IIT Delhi’s COVID-19 Test Kits to be Probe Free
Unlike the usual test kits for Coronavirus which are based on probe-based testing protocol, the testing method developed by IIT Delhi Researchers is probe free. It is based on PCR-based diagnostic assay, which will significantly bring down the test cost without compromising on the accuracy of the test results. A senior official from IIT Delhi has also been reported as saying by the PTI news agency that the test kit development by IIT Delhi researchers is the first probe free assay for COVID-19 that has received ICMR’s approval.
The approval of ICMR to IIT Delhi’s new testing technique or method for COVID-19 testing comes in the backdrop of the council halting testing for Coronavirus using the ‘faulty’ anti-body test kits imported from China. These imported test kits have shown variation in results and have not been effecting in helping agencies track the spread of the virus in hotspot areas. "
Africa welcomes latest Chinese donation of medical supplies in fighting COVID-19 - China. 	"The latest batch of massive medical supplies donated by China to 12 African countries and regions arrived on Thursday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa through the Ethiopian Airlines Caro Services.
High-level officials and representatives of national and international offices as well as diplomats and representatives of the African Union (AU) and the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) attended the arrival and delivery ceremony held on the premises of the Ethiopian Airlines Cargo terminal in Addis Ababa on Thursday afternoon.
Noting the rapid increase of COVID-19 across different parts of the African continent, the high-level officials and experts attending the arrival ceremony hailed the donation for its great contribution to deal with the epidemic across the African continent.
The medical supplies include facial masks, disposable protective clothing, forehead thermometers, medical protective goggles, gloves and shoe covers for medical use, among other equipments, it was noted.
Tan Jian, Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, said during the occasion that the COVID-19 outbreak ""has dragged the whole human race into a fierce war on a global scale. The virus is new and highly infectious. The attack is sudden and unprecedented.""
""A friend in need, is a friend indeed. The China-Africa cooperation in fighting COVID-19 is a telling testament to our friendship,"" the ambassador affirmed.
Noting that China ""has received heart-warming help and support from Africa at the most trying stage of China's fight against the outbreak,"" Tan stressed that the ""profound friendship will always be remembered and cherished by the Chinese people.""
The medical supplies are expected to be transferred to 12 African countries and regions that are Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Djibouti, Lesotho, Madagascar, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia as well as Tanzania's Zanzibar.
Ethiopia has already received medical supplies from China recently, while more is said to be on the way to the East African country, while another batch of China-aided medical supplies has been shipped to some other African countries via Accra, Ghana earlier this month.
According to the Africa CDC, the death toll from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the African continent reached 1,242 as the number of confirmed cases hit 25,937 as of Thursday afternoon.
Dawit Yirga, Director General of Asia and Oceania Affairs at the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also stressed that Africa and China are ""all weather friends and the Sino-Africa strategic partnership has shown vitality and strength in this time of unprecedented challenges.""
China, which is also presently fighting against COVID-19 at home, is winning acclaim from across the African continent for its solidarity and support to African countries and regional organizations in the continent's fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
As part of China's support to Africa's efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, Chinese experts and officials from health and customs departments also shared information and experience about COVID-19 in a video conference with officials and healthcare specialists from the African Union (AU), the Africa CDC as well as various African countries, showing commitment to sharing experience and supporting Africa in the fight against the pandemic.
Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines Group, also commended the solidarity demonstrated to Africa by the Chinese government as well as Chinese companies and civil societies on the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO also stressed that the airlines' successful partnership with different actors in delivering the life-saving medical supplies across the African continent is showed the true African integration in line with the AU Vision 2063. "
Scripps becomes first in region to treat COVID-19 patients with experimental convalescent plasma therapy -. 	Scripps Health has announced that they have successfully treated a coronavirus patient with experimental convalescent plasma therapy. Convalescent plasma therapy involves taking plasma donated by someone who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing it into a hospitalized patient currently battling a serious COVID-19 infection. Robert Riordan being treated with experimental convalescent plasma therapy Scripps Health supplied KUSI News with the following press release detailing the treatment: SAN DIEGO (April 24, 2020) — Scripps Health recently became the first health care provider in San Diego County to use an experimental therapy as a possible treatment for COVID-19 patients. The treatment involves taking plasma donated by someone who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing it into a hospitalized patient currently battling a serious COVID-19 infection. The idea behind the treatment – known as convalescent plasma therapy – is that people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their plasma that can attack the virus when transfused into patients with serious, active disease. On April 22, Encinitas resident Robert Riordan came to the Scripps Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Scripps Green Hospital to donate plasma. Riordan was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 19 after a ski trip to Colorado. He has been symptom-free since March 27. Riordan is the second person who came to Scripps to donate convalescent plasma, which will be transfused into a patient being treated in the intensive care unit at Scripps Green. The first convalescent plasma collection and transfusion took place at Scripps Green with a different donor and patient on April 1. While the therapy is still experimental, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 24 allowed doctors to use plasma from recovered patients to treat those with “serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections” under an emergency approval system. Doctors can apply to the FDA to use it for their patients, and the agency will review the requests quickly and make decisions on a case by case basis. The first convalescent plasma treatments in the U.S. for COVID-19 were performed in late March in New York and Texas, and other centers throughout the country are now adopting the therapy. Doctors and researchers will be monitoring progress closely, as they know it will take time to determine how well convalescent plasma works against COVID-19. Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Society described convalescent plasma treatment administered to five critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Shenzhen, China. The patients recovered to varying degrees after their treatments, and while the study was small and only observational, it raises the possibility that convalescent plasma therapy may be helpful in treating this patient population. The strategy of transfusing convalescent plasma has been used in the past to treat viral disease outbreaks of polio, measles, and mumps before a vaccine was available. More recently it’s has been used with some effectiveness to treat patients with SARS and Ebola. During an evolving pandemic like COVID-19, plasma-based treatments can provide a critical stopgap while therapies and vaccines are being developed. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid that remains after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood. For more information on convalescent plasma donation, call 858-554-4340.

We are running a second test on this patient as we have done for the seven persons already tested positive for best practice and quality assurance.” Mr Dakulala said “Remember, please do not stigmatise or discriminate our brother and sisters who have contracted the coronavirus or Covid-19.” He said PNG now has a total number of eight cases with the recent patient from Goroka. “For the points of entry update at our airports and seaports as of 20 April 2020, a total of 30,424 people have been screened out of which 7454 have been identified as persons of interest.” “From this group we have cleared 7,176 after going through the process of tests and quarantine etc. The remaining POIs still being followed are now 209.” For the PNG Covid-19 surveillance update as of April 24, the surveillance team has collected 1,624 samples for testing, out of which 559 have been tested. Of this, 551 came back negative and eight positive. We have a total of 7390 POIs as of April 21. Figures for each of the 22 provinces: nNCD – 3732, "
Are Melting Icecaps Bringing Corona Virus to Life?. 	Could there be a link between climate change and corona virus outbreak? Melting ice caps are releasing some viruses that were lying frozen and dormant for ages. The warming temperatures have stirred them to life and they have woken up with a vengeance. Corona virus could be one of them, they say. It has so far taken 362 lives and laid sick more than 14,000 people. The viruses attack the species lower in the food chain. Insects, animals and birds have immunity much lower than humans, hence are the first to catch the virus. Humans that come in contact with such animals get infected. Scientists have known all along that infectious disease transmission patterns are likely to be a major consequence of climate change. To back it with evidence, work is on at World Health Organisation to study the underlying relationship. Results of these studies will help predict future impacts, using better validated models. Instead of panicking, scientists say, it is better to take the necessary precautions as there is no known cure for corona virus yet. Places that have high temperatures are safer as the heat will kill the virus, scientists say, giving a ray of hope in an alarming scenario. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. 
Texas Tech laboratory to decontaminate masks for safe reuse during COVID-19. 	"Texas Tech University ’s Biological Threat Research Laboratory, part of The Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH), has partnered with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) to decontaminate some personal protective equipment (PPE), allowing it to be reused safely.
N95 masks and other small items can be decontaminated up to 20 times, substantially extending the lifespan of these items at a time when they are so badly needed and in such short supply, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The service is extended to all health care personnel, first responders and detention centers.
The move is the latest in a series of Texas Tech-TTUHSC initiatives to increase the availability of PPE. Texas Tech faculty and staff have collected more than 137,000 items , including 3,000 N95 masks , for donation to the TTUHSC and other regional health care facilities. The West Texas 3D COVID-19 Relief Consortium , a collaborative group of faculty from Texas Tech and TTUHSC, is working to create 3D-printed face shields and face masks for health care workers as well as ventilators and ventilator components.
The Biological Threat Research Laboratory was the first laboratory in the state of Texas to conduct COVID-19 testing ."

Lewis and Clark County to begin lifting COVID-19 restrictions . 	"Lewis and Clark County will be adopting a directive issued by Governor Steve Bullock and begin lifting some restrictions that were put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The directive was discussed by the City-County Board of Health during its regular meeting Thursday and voted to move forward in concert with the state.
Lewis and Clark County Health Officer Drenda Niemann says the county is cautiously optimistic moving forward and that the responsibility for keeping the community safe continues to lie with everyone as individuals.
Guidance is being developed by Lewis and Clark Public Health (LCPH) to specific types of businesses to help them reopen.
According to a release from LCPH, the documents will provide a summary of the governor’s requirements, as well as health department recommendations for additional protection, which will be available on the LCPH website here .
Guidance for places of worship and “main street” retail businesses, which are allowed to open in the next several days, are currently available.
Businesses that are uncomfortable about opening safely are being encouraged by Niemann to consider staying closed, Niemann saying they don’t have to open just because they’re allowed to.
The health department will monitor the local disease situation closely and they have the authority to reinstate restrictions if circumstances indicate a need Niemann said.
For now, an order closing public and private developed campgrounds until May 31 will remain in place. The order will be considered by Niemann to be rescinded or extended depending on the status of other campgrounds, such as those monitored by the Forest Service and state Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
The campground order does not apply to camping in undeveloped campground areas or to people who live in developed campgrounds.
COVID-19 requirements will continue to be enforced by the health department when it receives complaints. The three-step complaint process involves:
A phone call from the health department to educate a business about the requirements;
An order of corrective action from the health officer detailing steps that must be taken to comply with requirements; and
A citation and/or fine of up to $500 for each day not in compliance."
STILL No Non-East Asian Deaths From Corona—But CNN’s Sanjay Gupta Won’t Admit It. 	"See also Do You Know All Coronavirus Victims Appear To Be Chinese? Thought Not! and STILL No Non-Chinese Deaths From Coronavirus, But The WASHINGTON POST Wants You To Rat Out Your Neighbors Anyway
The story so far: There is still no confirmed case of the Coronavirus killing anyone other than ethnic East Asians. The Drudge Report today ( February 15 ) features FRANCE REPORTS FIRST DEATH OUTSIDE ASIA... but the underlying story, from Bloomberg via Yahoo Finance, says the victim was an “80-year-old Chinese tourist.” Drudge, of course, is just scaring up clicks. But why does the rest of the Main Stream Media, and the medical Establishment, want to suppress a possibility that could relieve fears around the world: that the Coronavirus disproportionately impacts, and perhaps only kills, East Asians?
Now read on.
Taking the exact opposite tack to me, CNN Medical Talking Head Dr Sanjay Gupta recently asserted that Corona “doesn’t discriminate based on race. Why do we?”
Gupta put this most Woke of questions to CDC director Dr Robert Redfield in response to the Trump Administration’s having decided to, in Redfield’s words “temporarily suspend travel into the United States from individuals who were not Americans or permanent residents who had been in the hot zone in the last 14 days.” [ 'It's Coming': CDC Director Warns Coronavirus To Become Widespread Throughout United States, 'Probably Beyond 2020' , By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, February 14, 2020].
Now, obviously, it’s paranoid nonsense to claim that this Trump policy is discriminating based on “race.” Chinese-Canadians will have no problem entering the U.S. so long as they haven’t been in the “hot zone” or the last two weeks. In contrast, white British people who have been in the “hot zone “in the last fortnight, will be denied access to the U.S.
And this is perfectly sensible if the virus doesn’t discriminate based on race, because if you have been at the epicenter of the Corona outbreak, no matter what your race, then you could carry this deadly disease into the US, and it has an equal chance of impacting every US citizen.
Except, of course, as I have been saying for weeks, the disease apparently does indeed discriminate by race. There are long-recognized race differences in the susceptibility to flu-like viruses, which is why the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was far more devastating to Native Americans and Maoris than it was to whites (although Spanish flu, unlike Coronavirus so far, did kill a lot of other races). And certain kinds of flu seem to be more deadly to East Asians than they are to whites.
This is why, as I—alone, it seems – have been pointing out that the 2003 SARS outbreak, about which there was a similar panic, apparently ended up killing only, or at least primarily, East Asians.
I suspect the authorities actually do know the Coronavirus discriminates by race. If they don’t, then why did World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus declare this week that he opposed travel bans? Zero Hedge quoted him in its article above: “We reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.”
“Little public health benefit”? If Corona really doesn’t discriminate based on race, then the public health benefits of banning people coming from areas where the virus is rife from entering the US would obviously be enormous. From a utilitarian perspective, they would more than outweigh the negative impact of trade disruption and a few Chinese people having to hear unpleasant remarks about bat consumption.
There’s only one way these restrictions would have “little public health benefit” and would unjustifiably interfere with “international travel and trade”—if Corona was only fatal to Northeast Asians, and merely gave the overwhelming majority of Americans who caught it an irritating case of winter flu.
If that were the case – which it appears to be – then the head of the WHO might well question the wisdom of a travel ban.
While, naturally, being unable to be honest about why.
CDC director Redfield’s fears, quoted by Zero Hedge, that the disease will become a “community virus” endemic in U.S. is quite compatible with that: it may be confined to Chinese immigrant communities.
Similarly, there were a flurry of headlines last week that an “American woman” had died of Corona in Wuhan e.g. [ US citizen dies of Wuhan virus in first confirmed non-Chinese fatality , By Youyou Zhou, Quartz, February 8, 2020]. However, the Quartz story added: Scott Gottlieb, former head of the US Food and Drug Administration, told CNBC , “We will see more cases in the US and a lot will be undetected.” He added, however, that he did not expect an epidemic-level crisis in America.
How could Gottlieb be so sure there would be no epidemic in the U.S? Perhaps partly because this virus, like all such viruses, becomes less virulent as it transmits away from the epicenter. But more importantly: perhaps because there simply aren’t that many East Asians in the US—that is people who are likely to be severely affected by Corona—and they’re not going to pass it on to other Americans.
It can be emphasized enough that 60-year-old American who died in Wuhan was not, despite the implication of the Quartz headline, descended from people arrived on our shores in the Mayflower. She did not have a collateral ancestor who was hanged at Salem. She bears no hereditary guilt for her ancestors having held slaves in South Carolina. According to CNN:
The US Embassy in Beijing confirmed a 60-year-old American national had died on Thursday at the Jinyintian Hospital in Wuhan, while the Chinese government offered condolences for the death of “a Chinese-American.”
[ China has deadliest day for coronavirus as US national becomes first foreigner to die , By Lily Lee and Joshua Berlinger, CNN, February 8, 2020].
The Chinese government may be one of the most secretive in the world. But, fortunately, when it comes to “race” they are an honest to a degree that should Americans public officials and journalists blush. And China’s honesty only confirms that this is not a virus from which white people die.
Coronavirus looks like a rerun of SARS. And quite how the fact that SARS only killed East Asians has escaped people’s attention is worth considering in this new context.
Kevin MacDonald has argued that if the social pressure, and social benefits, are strong enough then we can force ourselves—through a process called “effortful control”—to believe that lies are true and to blind ourselves to facts which are not consistent with the worldview which it is beneficial accept [ Effortful Control, Explicit Processing, and the Regulation of Human Evolved Predispositions , by Kevin MacDonald, Psychological Review, 2008].
It only goes show how pathological our taboo on “race” has become. Race denial is so strong that possible race differences in the incidence of a disease cannot be mentioned, or even suggested.
If we want to avoid future suffering, panic and and death—whether due to viruses or whatever else—we must be like the Chinese, able to talk frankly about race.
Those who would stop us from doing so—such as Angela Saini , and perhaps Sanjay Gupta—are literally a danger to humanity itself."
Coronavirus: Vaccine makers take big financial risk in COVID-19 crisis. 	"In a series of breathtaking multibillion-dollar bets by vaccine makers, possible candidates to fight the new coronavirus are being prepared for production across the globe, before it’s even known whether any of them will work.It's one of the most dramatic examples of short cuts and streamlining aimed at meeting what many experts consider unrealistic U.S. target dates for a vaccine.Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, front and center at White House news conferences, has repeatedly told a pandemic-weary nation a vaccine against the virus may be ready in 12 to 18 months.That timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which typically takes many years. The fastest it has ever been done was for mumps, which took four years.“I think the goal of 18 months is one that will be very, very difficult to achieve,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “But it just may be our moon shot.”Manufacturing tens of millions of unproven vaccine doses on spec is unheard ofin vaccine production. It underscores the urgent need to have solutions ready as quickly as possible to stop a scourge that has killed almost 200,000 people worldwide and decimated the global economy. Coronavirus: Twin brothers die from pandemics – 100 years apart Not all who die are counted : What we know about people who may be missing from stats There is no certainty any of the experimental vaccines will work. If one does prove effective, getting it into the arms of people around the world will require another bold move: the Food and Drug Association would have to speed up its normal approval process, fast-tracking clinical trials and coordinating regulatory processes. As testing data becomes available, work on vaccines that fail or have unacceptable side effects will be stopped, and stockpiles of that vaccine will be destroyed.“This is indeed a brave new world,” said L.J. Tan chief strategy officer at the Immunization Action Coalition, which distribute information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is one of several major vaccine developers taking the leap.The company already has begun work to meet its promise of producing a billion doses of its vaccine, even with human trials months away, said Macaya Douoguih, the company’s head of clinical development of vaccines.The move is risky financially, but could shave a year or more off of the process.U.S.-based Pfizer has four coronavirus vaccine candidates it expects to enter clinical trials, possibly within the next week.The company has started ramping its production capacity to produce millions of vaccine doses by the end of the year – long before it knows which, if any, will pan out, the company told USA TODAY.“It’s absolutely unprecedented, and it shows the strong commitment by our industry to eradicate COVID-19 and get any future vaccine to patients as quickly as possible, despite the incredible risks involved,” said Phyllis Arthur, vice president of Infectious Diseases & Diagnostics Policy at the biotechnology industry group BIO.An international public-private partnership is making the biggest bet. The vaccine effort backed by the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), based in Oslo, Norway, is funded by 14 governments as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.K.'s Wellcome Trust.With $2 billion in financial support, it is helping 10 leading candidates manufacture vaccines “at risk,” said James Robinson, a consultant managing the manufacturing strategy for CEPI.“At risk” means CEPI is taking on all the financial costs, all the legal liability and the clinical trial costs, with no guarantee of a market.“Production has started for many programs at limited scale; full-scale production should be underway by summer,” Robinson said. The goal is, as testing progresses, scientists will be able to identify the most promising candidates and have substantial quantities of doses read to be deployed.The chance of failing is high but CEPI has confidence some of the 10 vaccine candidates will be successful. ""It's the bet we need to take to be sure we have one to three that will work,"" said Robinson.The financial risk to the companies is also unprecedented.“You’ve potentially just spent a million dollars to learn something interesting” but have nothing to show for it, said Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine.Vaccine manufacturing and production even in normal times is dicey. The rates of return are low and outbreaks can wane, pulling public attention and money away. That makes the decision to produce multiple vaccines before they’re tested all the more remarkable.“Companies don’t want to risk making all those doses until they know a vaccine is going to be licensed and can be sold,” said Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. But in today’s environment, the choices are stark.“Maybe you say, ‘This is a pandemic. It’s important enough that we’ll try,’” Neuzil said. “It’s absolutely a gamble. There’s no doubt about it.” It's possible there will be no vaccine. Vaccines for respiratory ailments have a history of setbacks. In 1966, two toddlers died from a vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV. It wasn't until late last year that any vaccine for that respiratory virus was approved. Vaccine developers also have to contend with antibody-dependent enhancement, where a possible vaccine ends up making it easier not harder for the virus to infect a cell.Then there’s the history of problems in making a vaccine against coronaviruses, of which SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19 is one.No one has ever developed a vaccine for the common cold, which is often caused by different strains of the coronavirus. Attempts at a vaccine for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome led to animals getting sick. The SARS virus is closely related to the COVID-19 virus.The urgency to stop the pandemic has brought together unprecedented resources and expertise to find a solution, yet it remains extremely difficult to develop a vaccine. It's one reason there is still nothing for HIV or the common cold, said Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on accelerating medical research.“It’s not an absolute guarantee, even though we have all these efforts underway,” she said.Osterholm, who wrote the bestseller, ""Deadliest Enemy"" about public health crises, believes we must presume one won't be found. That puts the burden on treatments and social distancing until the disease has run its course. He recently estimated 800,000 Americans will die of COVID-19.“I think our planning for responding to the pandemic has to be as if there is no vaccine,” said Osterholm, who has been involved as a public health expert in numerous epidemics over 35 years.“With a disease of this infectiousness, you probably are talking 60% to 70% of the population would have to be infected and develop immunity for us to see substantial reduction in transmission,” he said.Currently there are more than 70 vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2, according to the World Health​ Organization. The hope is that many will succeed. To protect the world’s 7.8 billion people will require multiple vaccines produced at dozens of facilities. No single vaccine maker can make enough doses for the entire population. A vaccine might be possible in late 2021 or early 2022 but it’s hard to say, said Jon Andrus, a professor of global vaccinology and vaccine policy at the Milken Institute of Public Health at George Washington University."

Corona Virus COVID19 in Astrology. 	Your instincts were correct about cancelling your Singapore and Japan flights ahead of WHO making its announcement. I am also worried about the Corona Virus, because of the timing. Astrology predicted 10th January 2020 almost a year before the first fatality (which took place on that date). In astrology we ‘read’ the symbols in the chart as similar: bugs and viruses. It now turns out it was both computer and human. My concern is really the Full Moon in Virgo opposite the Sun in Pisces on Monday 9th March which is a new crisis. That was also predicted, specifically about a virus, a few months ago. Further on, thinking about the Chinese in particular, we find an exact T-Square between Neptune at 19 Pisces (airborne invisible viruses) and the North Node at 19 Gemini (flights, short-haul transport)h and South Node at 19 Sagittarius (international relations, foreigners) between January 24th 2021 and January 27th. Ceres is also at 19 Pisces on January 23rd, 24th, 25th! That looks like a very difficult global response to the virus, which may be mutating by then, or is not curable. We have to pay attention to any time the Nodes in Gemini and Sagittarius turn up, because it’s so rare – only every 19 years. Forming a T-Square to Neptune suggests this Corona Virus is not going to be easily sorted out. I believe I predicted the end of Communism in China in another feature. Have a look on Search. Thank you for your information!
Artificial Intelligence from Epic Triggers Fast, Lifesaving Care for COVID-19 Patients. 	"One of the most challenging things about COVID-19 for healthcare providers is how quickly some cases of the disease become life-threatening. A predictive model from Epic, the company that supports the comprehensive health records of 250 million people, is helping doctors intervene with life-saving care before hospitalized patients deteriorate. ""This is helping save lives. The model predicts which patients are getting worse and will need more care. It shows us if things are changing rapidly,"" said Dr. Daniel David, Clinical Professor of Medicine at Confluence Health, an integrated healthcare organization serving North Central Washington.
Hundreds of hospitals are using the predictive model. It evaluates patients' risk of getting sicker in real time by tracking thousands of pieces of data generated by heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and other monitors. The model helps clinicians by rapidly analyzing data from these sources and notifying staff if things are getting worse. Notifications are displayed on screen, included in reporting dashboards, or pushed out to clinicians' smartphones.
""Frontline healthcare workers are busy caring for patients. By keeping a watchful eye, the system helps clinicians direct their attention to patients who need it most,"" said Seth Hain, Epic data scientist and Senior Vice President of Research and Development.
Epic has enlisted research organizations like Stanford Health Care to validate the model for COVID-19. Many organizations, such as Confluence Health, have completed validation and are already using it for these patients.
The predictive model is one of many analytics tools Epic and its customers are bringing to the fight against COVID-19. Another tool, SlicerDicer allows doctors to combine and sort through data in different ways. For example, if a doctor suspects that there is a COVID-19 hotspot in her community, she can verify it by using the system to cross-reference positive tests with patient ZIP Codes. She can then alert public health officials.
Epic is also working with its customers to find an easy way to get the right data to public health officials in order to help them understand and limit the spread of the pandemic.
Epic puts patients at the heart of everything we do by helping people get well and stay well. Visit www.epic.com/about ."

‘Everyone has to start from scratch’ following Covid-19. 	"Bidvest Wits midfielder Cole Alexander is adamant that it’s not only the Clever Boys who are being affected by the national lockdown, saying that all the teams in top-flight football will start from scratch should the season resume.
Leading up to the national lockdown, which started late in March in a bid to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic, Wits had an impressive run of form with four points out of a possible six, while they also progressed to the semi-finals of Nedbank Cup.
In their first postponed match, the Braamfontein, Joburg-based side were supposed to clash with Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs, who have a 10-point lead and have played a game extra, in a match that should have been played at FNB Stadium.
Three days later, the Clever Boys would have met fourth-placed Orlando Pirates, also away from home at Orlando Stadium.
Well, the permutations were simple: Wits needed maximum points from both away matches if they were to keep their title aspirations alive.
“Before the lockdown, I think we were doing well, bagging points and winning games. We had some momentum. But I think that the break hasn’t come at the right time. The lockdown, though, is not only affecting Wits but every team in the country,” Alexander said yesterday.
“We need to do the things that we can control. As professional players, we are all at home and have the time on our hands. And what we do with the time at home should allow us to compete when we come back, so that we are not far behind in our fitness.”

Indians panic over rumors that corona virus is linked to broilers. 	Indian poultry farmers are worried that rumors connecting the spread of the corona virus to poultry are disrupting the industry. The Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association of Maharashtra filed a complaint with the Cyber Cell of the Pune Police against the rumors. Since the rumors started spreading last week, the industry noted a USD 0.14/kg drop in the farm gate price of chicken. “Lower consumption is the reason,” said the Association to the media. They fear that if this continues there may be a 50% drop in consumption.

Enforcement Policy for Non-Invasive Fetal and Maternal Monitoring Devices Used to Support Patient Monitoring During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency . 	"Docket Number: FDA-2020-D-1138 Issued by: Guidance Issuing Office Office of Medical Products and Tobacco, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of non-invasive fetal and maternal monitoring devices to facilitate patient monitoring while reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and potential exposure to COVID-19 during this pandemic.
This policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Services (PHS) Act.
Given this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled "" Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 ,"" this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.

Study: 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Receptors Show Similarities to SARS. 	"In a new study, a team of researchers from the University of Minnesota and the University of North Carolina has analyzed the potential receptor usage by the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and the recently released sequence of the new virus. TEM image of 2019-nCoV particles. Image credit: Zhu et al , doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001017.
“The recent emergence of 2019-nCoV puts the world on alert,” said senior author Dr. Fang Li from the Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Minnesota and colleagues.
“2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003.”
“Our decade-long structural studies have shown how SARS-CoV interacts with animal and human hosts in order to infect them. The mechanics of infection by 2019-nCoV appear to be similar.”
Dr. Li and co-authors used the knowledge they gleaned from multiple strains of SARS-CoV — isolated from different hosts in different years — and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors from different animal species to model predictions for the new coronavirus.
Both viruses use ACE2 to gain entry into the cell, but it serves normally as a regulator for heart function. Left: experimentally determined structure of the interface between a designed SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) — optimized for human ACE2 recognition — and human ACE2. Right: modeled structure of the interface between 2019-nCoV RBD and human ACE2; here mutations were introduced to the RBD region in left panel based on sequence differences between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Image credit: Wan et al , doi: 10.1128/JVI.00127-20.
“Our structural analyses confidently predict that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its host receptor,” the researchers said.
“That and several other structural details of the new virus are consistent with the ability of the new coronavirus to infect humans and with some capability to transmit among humans.”
“Alarmingly, our data predict that a single mutation — at a specific spot in the genome — could significantly enhance 2019-nCoV’s ability to bind with human ACE2.”
“For this reason, 2019-nCoV evolution in patients should be closely monitored for the emergence of novel mutations at the 501 position in its genome, and to a lesser extent, the 494 position, in order to predict the possibility of a more serious outbreak than has been seen so far.”
The findings were published in the Journal of Virology , a journal of the American Society for Microbiology."
Using mask over corona virus unnecessary: IEDCR . 	"Use of mask and other personal precautions like hand sanitizer over the panic of corona virus in the country is unnecessary, experts said.
“Using mask to avoid corona virus is useless in our country. Even there is no need of taking any personal precaution over the virus as the virus is yet to reach our country,” Principal Scientific Officer of Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) Dr ASM Alamgir told BSS.
Dr Alamgir, also the chief of the corona virus control room of IEDCR, urged people not to spread any kind of rumor over the deadly virus.
IEDCR, country’s state-run disease monitoring wing, has screened a total of 5,952 China returnees until February 3 from January 21, 2020, he said.
“We received the test results and found nobody was infected with the virus,” IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora told BSS.
“Those who were admitted at Kurmitola General Hospital were sent to Ashkona Hajj camp on Sunday night. However, one was sent back to Kurmitola Hospital for monitoring after he was found to have high body temperature,” she added.
The disease monitoring wing, already running four hotline numbers — 01937110011, 01937000011, 01927711784 and 01927711785 — to solve any type of confusion about the virus and creating awareness among people.
Till yesterday, it received 290 phone calls while screened 39 suspects and found all negative for the virus.
Television sets and Wi-Fi connection have been provided for the China returnees at the Ashkona Hajj Camp, she said.
A total of 312 Bangladeshis were brought back to Dhaka from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the locked down epicenter of the deadly corona virus outbreak that has sparked a global health emergency. "

Erdogan said equality between men and women “against nature”
Erdogan said :
1. cannot put women and men on equal footing, against nature 2. urged women to have at least three children 3. woman’s life “incomplete” if she did not reproduce 4. woman who says ‘I am working I will not be a mother’ denying her feminity
5. woman who rejects motherhood is deficient, incomplete
My comments :
Of course men and women are physically not equal.
The average American male (20 - 39 yrs old) weighs 197 pounds. The average American female is 30 pounds lighter.
Usain Bolt holds the world record (men) for the 100 meters at 9.58 seconds. The very feminine Florence Griffith Joyner or FloJo holds the women's record at 10.49 seconds.
Florence G Joyner 1959 -1998
But those are physical aspects.
Intellectually men and women are not equal either. All over the world women seem to achieve higher levels of education than men. And statistics do show that women have (on average) slightly higher IQ than men. This is a late 20th century phenomenon and is increasing all over the world.
In modern manufacturing female workers can outproduce male workers. The same applies in modern agriculture.
Males outperform females in heavy manufacturing and heavy labour like construction. Males are still better at lifting 50 kg bags of cement all day.
The world is constantly changing, and for a very large part it is changing for the better.
The right word to use is modernising.
Etymology of 'modern' - From Middle French moderne, from Late Latin modernus; from Latin modo (“just now”), originally modus (“measure”); hence, by measure, ""just now"".
Modern relates to measuring the uptodate status of something.
So it is very appropriate to ask questions like :
Is this the latest technology? Is this the latest version of this engine? Is this the newest design? Is this the most effective method? Is this the most uptodate software? Is this the latest surgical method ?
These are everyday questions which everyone asks. Why do we ask this everyday question? Because as human beings we need to reassure ourselves that our species the human beings are progressing. That our lives are improving today compared to yesterday. And that tomorrow will see more improvement than today. So we really want to constantly modernise. That is the key to our success as the human species.
So with reference to today, anything that does not provide scope for 'modernising' has to be Stone Age. Jahiliyah or ignorant.
Culture, traditions (including superstitions) and religion are not modern.
They seek to preserve the old (traditional Japanese sword making). Or they seek to be stuck in a rut (religion).
Hence traditional swordmaking and swords have no practical use to human beings. Other than displaying them on a wall or for recreational use (in a dozo).
What about religion ? Religion is the opposite of modern. There is no such thing as the latest, the newest or uptodate in religion. Religion is as uptodate as its age. If a religion is 5000 years old, then its adherents are dinosaurs. If a religion is 1000 years old then its adherents are dinosaurs.
There is no progression (modernisation) beyond the age of that religion.
That is why you see the type of arguments to justify forcing under aged girls to marry their 'rapists' or 'partners' in places like Turkey, North Africa and the Middle East.
These regions still suffer an overdose of religion and old traditions. Which means they are not modern. Without modernisation they have to be backward. There is no compromise between the two.
Of course I am talking about organised religion only. Of course I consider myself a thoroughly modern human being. Of course I must believe in an orderly way of life.

The Corona Virus Hysteria: Some REAL Truth About This 'Deadly' Virus - The Median Age Of Wuhan Virus Fatalities Is 75!. 	"I continue to monitor the ludicrous reports being thrown out there by the LIARS in the Jew spew media outlets... It is so disgusting to see those ass clowns now try to go nearly 24/7 round the clock ""reporting"" on this supposed and alleged ""epidemic"" in China, while at the same time trying to scare the living hell out of viewers with false claims that this ""epidemic"" will soon be here in North America I have already shown in the previous article about this hysteria and fraud how these criminals have been trying to sell the gullible public the lies that there are ""people falling over and dying in the streets"" from this Corona Virus, and I have another key point to bring forward in this article as well...
I want to present the following most interesting report, that comes from Marko Marjanovic, through the Aletho News website, at www.alethonews.com, that shows that the median age of those who have supposedly died from this ""killer"" virus is 75 YEARS of age! Here in fact is that report, and I have further thoughts and comments to follow:
The Median Age of Wuhan Virus Fatalities Is 75 By Marko Marjanović | Anti-Empire | January 24, 2020 When a new disease appears a measure of concern is natural since we don’t know yet what we’re dealing with, but just statistically it’s highly unlikely a disease, just because it is new, will be particularly deadly. On the contrary, chances are a new disease will be no more deadly or untreatable than the average existing one. We can applaud China for taking the threat seriously, just to be on the safe side, but there is no reason to fall for the media’s relentless attempts to maximize your stress levels. They’ll use every trick in the book to maximize your attention and earn a bigger advertiser buck. We go through this every couple of years. Mad cow disease, bird flu, SARS, ebola are just a few of the past examples. In the end, none of them ever racked up high body counts. The Wuhan virus has so far killed 26 people, all of whom were elderly or had pre-existing conditions. In fact, the median age of the first 19 victims is 75-years old. This new disease so far looks like a type of flu, quite possibly a weaker and more survivable strain. The common flu kills 300,000-600,000 people yearly, depending on the year. Likewise overwhelmingly among the elderly.
NTS Notes: Yes, the facts are that this Corona Virus has indeed caused some deaths in Wuhan, China.. But what is NOT being told is that the vast majority of the victims of this ""deadly disease"" have already been suffering from ailments that weaken their immune system!
And the facts are that the majority of those who have fallen victim to this ""epidemic"" are the elderly, and according to the list most probably again have failing immune systems and are already suffering from other diseases and respiratory illnesses It therefore shows that those who are much younger and stronger may also contract this disease, but due to their stronger immune systems are more readily able to fight off the disease....
Readers, what we have here is further proof that all of this fear mongering from those who are trying to sell the notion that this is an ""epidemic"" in the making is nothing but bull crap, and the proponents of that stupidity are full of shit
I will say that it is sad that there are indeed victims of this virus.... But for the Jew spew media to try to sell the notion that this is an ""epidemic in the making"" and that everyone could be infected and possibly die is not only hysteria, but absolutely abominable! But again, they have their marching orders, and the agenda behind this propaganda is obvious in trying to get everyone to line up and get their ""vaccine"" for this ""disease"" the moment it becomes available.... Do not be fooled, everyone.."

I am Chinese from Wuhan, no one can leave the city or enter the city, total cases here is 170 dead, over 5000 infected
We cannot leave the city anymore, we cannot allow others to enter the city, the army is guarding all exit-entry point. All forms of mass transit have been lockdowned, including the airport, they will let us all die here
I'm seen soldiers in full hazmat suits here in Hanyang, from my second floor appartment window, they are spraying something fluid on the streets via large trucks using water cannons
USING VPN, here it is not allowed to talk-criticize about the virus, jail sentence is sure if one does
Fang Zhong, within the institute people are very very alarmed of what will happen to us
I know personaly that at least two IOPCAS scientists have been put under house arrest, the virus is not what the WEST thinks, it is much more dangerous because it mutates from person to person, at first slightly, but could re-emmerge under total different form within weeks
Our collegues counted over 5000 cases within the city center as of yesterday 1pm
They will never let us leave the city, because the virus will spread within exponentially, doubling every two days, this is extremelly contagious, the virus stays in the air for 24 to 48 hours
People will panick, the sun rises very soon, most are unaware that the city is on total lockdown
In Baofeng sector alone, our collegues counted 1400 cases, many people have dissapeared, their loved ones searching for them in hospitals
I go to Central China University, I am from Changsha
Do you have somewhere stocked with supplies where you can shelter in place for a few weeks (or months) where you can wait it out? Is your family trapped in the city with you?
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77547432
No, in China it is not possible, cameras see everything, we would be labelled as enemies and traitors, we must stay put and wait from Central Party orders
There is panic and choas in all are Wuhan hospitals, people are dissapearing with no trace and no bodies are found
Stay safe.What is the origin of this virus? I heard it originated from local food market.Probably some kind of animal was source
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 78370173
They say here Guinea pigs
All my family is outside the city, so they will be ok, they live in rural area, we fear about the water, we are wondering if the water gets infected, what do we do?
No more N95 mask can be found since last Sunday, not one left in the city
When people wake up, the entire city will want to leave, it's going to be crazy, most people here are sleeping and don't know they can't exit the city
I see people leaving, in my apprtment block light are starting to blink, people are waking up and hearing the news, my neighbour is leaving, they say the roads are still free to get out of Wuhan, I don't know, but there will be huge traffic jams
The last planes are landing at the airport and the people don't know they won't be able to leave
Thank you, yes I'm staying put, the University will be closed I think
Convoy of large army trucks here in Yuanbaoshan area in Wuhan
That was nothing, he needed help with electric wires, no more power. It is confirmed, army is securing road blocks at all entry exit points in Wuhan, they say it is a massive operation
There are many people living here who are very poor, with bad health, supplies won't be coming in anymore, or very little
Our running water system is very weak, if the workers cannot get transportion to the plant, it will shut down (I got the answer to the question earlier)
I am leaving with a small cart my neighbour gave me for helping him, going to buy as much food and drinking water as possible, my supermarket opens in 20 min"
This person spread corona virus in many countries of the world. 	"The search for businessman Steve Walsh is now complete. Walsh is currently in a London hospital. The person is accused of inadvertently infecting many people with the corona virus. Walsh is currently free from Corona infection and is housed in the Quarantine Center.
Steve Walsh arrived in January to attend a sales conference of UK gas analytics firm Servomex. Here he became infected with Corona. 109 delegates were present at the luxurious Hyatt Hotel in Singapore for the conference. After some time, corona virus was found in many of these people.
In fact, two South Korean citizens who had come to attend the Singapore conference had fallen ill with the infection of a Malaysian patient.
Three more who came to the conference were found to be infected, after which its case came to light in Europe. Walsh was also present here.
After the conference, Walsh went on a France vacation with his wife. During this time, four of his friends in Britain who came into contact with him were infected with Corona. A Spanish citizen, who came in contact with Walsh, found himself infected after returning home. In this way, Walsh had already infected 11 people with Corona.
At the same time, in view of the corona virus outbreak in China, the Ministry of Home Affairs has extended screening procedures such as airport at the borders to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) as security preventive measures to avoid infection. Is directed to adopt.
In an advisory issued this week, the ministry has instructed the ITBP, SSB and other departments to maintain vigilance at the borders about the Novel Corona virus.
The virus has been given a new name, Kovid-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). "
Biocartis Group NV: Biocartis Announces Development of Idylla COVID-19 test. 	"Mechelen, Belgium, 23 April 2020 - Biocartis Group NV (the 'Company' or 'Biocartis'), an innovative molecular diagnostics company (Euronext Brussels: BCART), today announces the development of a SARS-CoV-2 test, the virus that causes COVID-19, on the fully automated, rapid and easy to use molecular diagnostics platform Idylla™. Upon regulatory approval, the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 test is targeted to help healthcare providers manage the COVID-19 pandemic through rapid and easy testing of individuals with flu-like symptoms. In addition, the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 test may be used in combination with the recently CE-marked IVD SeptiCyte ® RAPID Test 1 on Idylla™ to facilitate the management of patients within the hospital intensive care unit (ICU). When used together, this combined testing solution on Idylla™ has the unique potential to identify patients with severe disease, as recent data 2 indicate that sepsis is the most frequently observed complication in COVID-19 3 . Biocartis develops the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 test with support from multiple undisclosed partners as part of a joint commitment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 test will be based on the Idylla™ Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel 4 that received 510(k) clearance by the US FDA on 5 September 2017 and is being designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs. Subject to a successful 'Emergency Use Authorization' by the US FDA, launch of the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 test is expected in the second half of 2020 5 . The US FDA 510(k) clearance of the SeptiCyte ® RAPID Test on Idylla™ is expected along the same timelines.
The SeptiCyte ® RAPID Test (CE-IVD) on Idylla™ is a rapid host-response 6 test, developed in collaboration with Immunexpress Pty Ltd ('Immunexpress' ) , that distinguishes sepsis from non-infectious SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and provides actionable results in about one hour 7 . On 26 March 2020 , Biocartis announced that it would lead the commercialization of this test in Europe as the exclusive distributor, while Immunexpress will lead commercialization in the US.
Herman Verrelst, Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis, commented : "" Developing a respiratory panel device detecting SARS-CoV-2 on Idylla™, especially when used in unique combination together with the Septicyte ® RAPID Test on Idylla™, is expected to address the significant current and longer term unmet needs in hospitals and specifically in ICU's to more efficiently triage patients with flu-like symptoms. As such, unnecessary ICU admissions could potentially be prevented or average length of hospital stays could be reduced."""

Commissioner Nikki Fried highlights $522 million in COVID-19 crop losses. 	"On April 23, Agriculture Commissioner Nicole “Nikki” Fried and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) released the Florida Seasonal Crop COVID-19 Impact Assessment, a new report providing data on crop losses facing Florida farmers. Based on figures reported by growers, total crop losses across the state through mid-April 2020 may exceed $522.5 million. Florida is the nation’s second-largest producer of seasonal specialty crops such as blueberries, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and more.
Florida Seasonal Crop COVID-19 Impact Assessment:
The Florida Seasonal Crop COVID-19 Impact Assessment was assembled utilizing phone interviews with growers on April 15, 2020. It should be noted that markets, as well as selling and purchase strategies, change rapidly for most crop sectors with the current conditions of the market. Fluctuations for these projected figures should be expected. Below is information on six of the eleven seasonal crops surveyed to collect value loss data for the Florida Seasonal Crop
Selected crop loss data:
Lettuce: Circumstances have driven sales down by at least 60% for the season, with estimates of 75% or more of the crop being plowed under. A conservative value loss estimate for the Florida lettuce industry is $5-7 million. Some growers in this industry still have one month of harvest left to complete, and report that a more precise estimate will be available once the season ends in mid-May.
Green beans: Estimated crop losses of green beans in Florida ranges from 50-75% and prices have fallen from $16-18 per box to $6-8 per box in one week. This crop loss cumulatively could range from 75-100% in Central and North Florida, where harvest season has just begun. Industry estimates may approach $40-50 million in overall losses. This crop is approaching heavy scheduled volumes and peak production in coming weeks.
Cabbage: Overall demand for Florida cabbage has decreased by almost 100% following the closure of processed product markets for food service. Estimates of crop losses approach $24 million for the Florida cabbage industry.
Zucchini/Squash: Growers of zucchini and squash are harvesting the crop only where pre-existing contracts are in place or for the purpose of preserving plants. With 25% of the product still remaining in fields, prices have dropped from $28 per box to as low as $3 per box. Estimated losses on Florida zucchini and squash are $17 million for each crop. These crops are approaching heavy scheduled volumes and peak production in coming weeks.
Peppers: It is estimated that up to at least 25% of the overall Florida pepper crop has yet to be picked, as growers are harvesting only to cover pre-existing contracts, and then are shutting down production quickly to minimize further losses. Each crop is typically only seeing one to two picks, resulting in approximately 20% of the total pepper business being plowed under this season. Estimated losses are at least $10 million on Florida peppers.
Cucumbers: Many South Florida companies grow cucumbers for the spring market, and 100% of that spring market crop may now be plowed under. Industry estimates approach up to $38 million in overall losses. This crop is approaching heavy scheduled volumes and peak production in coming weeks. "
No 2019-nCoV case in UERMMMC. 	"The Manila City Public Information Office (PIO) dispelled rumors that there is a patient suspected of carrying the 2019-novel coronavirus at the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Center (UERMMMC) in Quezon City.
Dr. Paz Corrales (DOH)
Dr. Paz Corrales, assistant regional director of the Department of Health, confirmed to the Manila City government that there is no person under investigation (PUI) for the virus in the said hospital, the Manila PIO said in a statement released Friday afternoon.
Rumors of a senior high school student from UE Manila being admitted and quarantined at the UEEMMMC quickly made the rounds on social media.
This led the UE Manila management to suspended classes from pre-school to senior high schools levels on Friday to conduct disinfection and general cleaning activities.
Latest data from the Department of Health showed that the Philippines has 215 PUIs for the new virus from China.
Of this figure, three tested positive, 57 tested negative, while 155 still have pending laboratory results.
All three confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in thd country involved Chinese nationals from Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.
One of them, a 44-year-old Chinese man, died on February 1, the first fatality due to the virus reported outside of China.
The two other cases, who are Chinese women aged 38 and 60, already tested negative for the virus."
COVID-19 takes unequal toll on immigrants in Nordic region. 	"Sadad Dakhare (R), his father Mohamed Dakhare Farah and niece Safa Mohamed Hassan (L) who fell ill with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but have now recovered. The first person in Sadad Dakhare's two-bedroom apartment in Oslo, Norway, to show symptoms was his 4-year-old niece. Next, his mother, his sister and he himself fell ill. Then, about a week after his niece became sick, Dakhare heard his 76-year-old father coughing heavily.
He found his father lying in bed, gasping for air. ""Just call an ambulance,"" the father told Dakhare.
At an Oslo hospital, Dakhare's father tested positive for COVID-19 and was treated for a few days before he was discharged to finish his recovery at home.
The Dakhare family's story is a familiar one among Somalis in Norway and other Nordic countries, where the pandemic is taking a disproportionate toll on some immigrant groups. Governments in Sweden, Norway and Finland are taking extra steps to try to slow the spread of the disease in these communities.
Across Europe, little is known about who is affected by the virus because governments are releasing limited demographic information about the sick and those who die. But a Reuters examination of government data in three Nordic countries where more details are available shows that some immigrant groups are among those affected at higher rates than the general populace.
""WORRYING"" DISPARITY
In Norway, where 15% of residents were born abroad, 25% who had tested positive for COVID-19 by April 19 were foreign-born. Somalis, with 425 confirmed cases, are the largest immigrant group testing positive, accounting for 6% of all confirmed cases -- more than 10 times their share of the population.
Somalis are the most overrepresented immigrant group among Sweden's confirmed cases, as well. Their 283 positive tests account for about 5% of the nearly 6,000 cases documented between March 13 and April 7. That's seven times their share of the population. Iraqis, Syrians and Turks also made up disproportionately large shares of positive cases.
In Finland's capital city of Helsinki, the mayor said it was ""worrying"" that almost 200 Somalis had tested positive by mid-April. They accounted for about 17% of positive cases -- 10 times their share of the city's population.
More than 100,000 Somalia-born live in the three countries, mostly in Sweden and Norway, one of the largest Somali diasporas in the world. Many arrived as refugees of war in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Several factors place them more at risk of getting sick, public health officials and researchers say.
VIRUS OUTPACES RESPONSE
It is common in all three countries for multiple generations of Somalis to live, like the Dakhares do, in crowded apartments, making it easier for the virus to spread from one family member to the next. They also tend to work in high-contact jobs -- healthcare workers, drivers and cleaners, for example -- with a higher risk for exposure.
Language barriers also are at play, and some have criticized governments in Sweden and Norway for failing to move fast enough in communicating about the virus to immigrant groups.
""By the time information translated to different languages was spread sufficiently, the infection rate among minority groups was already very high,"" said Linda Noor, a social anthropologist who is managing director of Minotenk, a think tank focused on minority-related politics in Norway. She said a lot of information in Norway was distributed through national health authorities' websites that are unfamiliar to many people in immigrant communities.
Public health officials in both Norway and Sweden pointed to COVID-19 information they published in multiple languages, including Somali, in early to mid-March. But they acknowledged that they did not reach some immigrants fast enough.
GETTING THE WORD OUT
""I think it is clear from the epidemiological situation, especially looking at the high proportion of Somalis with COVID-19, that we did not reach this group in time,"" said Hilde Kløvstad, department director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
Once the virus started to spread, officials realized they needed to be more focused in their outreach, she said, adding that the spread of the virus among immigrant communities is slowing.
In Oslo, officials contacted leaders in immigrant communities, who helped them get the word out via social media, word of mouth, posters and online videos targeting Somalis, said Hanne Gjørtz, head of communications for the city. Health alerts in Somali aired on the radio, and text messages with translated information were sent to Somali residents.
""We saw that this led to increased traffic on our websites,"" she said.
""But we are constantly learning,"" she added. ""It would definitely have been an advantage to have videos and posters in place earlier in this crisis. This has been and still is a crisis of great speed, and it took some time for us to find the right ways to reach different groups.""
HITTING THE STREETS
In Rinkeby-Kista and Spånga-Tensta, two Stockholm boroughs where immigrants and their children make up most of the population, rates of infection are more than two times higher than in the city overall. Trying to slow the spread of the virus in these areas, where Somalis are the biggest minority group, the government is offering temporary furnished rental apartments to at-risk-groups, such as elderly people who live in multi-generational housing, said Benjamin Dousa, chairman of the Rinkeby-Kista district council.
Government workers who speak a variety of languages, including Somali, have hit the streets in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods -- near libraries, religious buildings, municipal offices, metro stations and grocery stores -- to warn people about COVID-19, said officials from government body Region Stockholm.
In a statement to Reuters, Region Stockholm said it could have been faster in distributing multilingual information before the virus began spreading disproportionately among immigrant groups.
""However, we are working in the middle of a situation which is before unseen,"" the statement said. ""Therefore, it is difficult to be as fast as is needed and to foresee all needs.""
The statement added that the infection rate is slowing in Spånga-Tensta and Rinkeby-Kista.
""SITUATION DEMANDS TEAMWORK""
Helsinki is gearing up for similar outreach.
""The situation demands enhanced teamwork, continued development of multilingual services and effective targeted communications,"" said Mayor Jan Vapaavuori. ""We have entered into discussions with the Finnish Somali League about new measures to improve the situation.""
Somalis themselves also are trying to spread the word about how to stay safe.
Ayan Abdulle posted an informational video on Facebook, but she found she wasn't reaching the people who needed the information most.
Abdulle, 29, who was born in Somalia and came to Norway at age 9, heads a non-governmental organization in the city of Bergen called Arawelo, which usually focuses on helping young immigrants apply for jobs and find friends. After the coronavirus outbreak, Abdulle started to focus on the elderly as well, helping them with grocery shopping. When she spoke with elderly Somali women out shopping last month, she learned they were not getting enough information about the coronavirus because they weren't using social media and not all of them understood Norwegian.
""In Somali culture, most information is spread by word of mouth,"" Abdulle said. ""Now we are going from door to door and hanging posters informing people about the symptoms and how dangerous the disease can be."""

Reality check: Experts caution against early research on nicotine and COVID-19. 	"A new study out of France suggests that nicotine could play a role in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 , but Canadian experts say people should avoid jumping to conclusions.
The Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris examined 480 coronavirus patients — 350 were hospitalized while the rest remained at home with less serious symptoms. They found that a low number of patients in both categories were smokers. Of those in hospital, 4.4 per cent were regular smokers, while about 5.3 per cent of those at home said they smoke.
The findings have already spurred clinical trials in France, where nicotine patches will be used on COVID-19 patients.

While the data is still inconclusive, disseminating this kind of information during a global pandemic hooked on lung disease is “irresponsible,” said Robert Schwartz, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health and executive director of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit.
 “This is one study done by one group. We have to wait and see on the evidence,” he told Global News.
“But if it turns out to be that nicotine plays a role here, we have to be extremely careful. If people start smoking cigarettes to get the nicotine, that’s going to do a whole lot more harm than COVID-19 is going to do.”

While there’s some weight in looking at the relationship between these cell receptors, it’s all just a guess right now, said Andrew Pipe of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, the leading Canadian expert on smoking cessation.

“The hypothesizing, it’s part of the scientific process. There will be a whole pile of concepts that will emerge, which may be worthy of further study, but they’re not ready for primetime,” he told Global News.
“I’m not dissing the concept, but look at the nature of it. The pandemic is such that absolutely there’s phenomenal interest on anything that stimulates that there may be a solution in some way, but that interest can be disproportionate to what’s being suggested here.”

Until then, the research about the dangers of smoking are clear, Schwartz said.
“We already have 47,000 people dying each year from using cigarettes here in Canada and billions around the world,” he said.
“As terrible as the deaths are from COVID-19, it doesn’t even reach the ankles of the number of deaths from smoking.”
Tweet This A 2016 study found “ample evidence” that cigarette smoke weakens the defensive function of the immune system. One from 2017 found that even social or occasional smoking can cause immense damage to a person’s body, leading to problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hypertension. There is “conclusive evidence that smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory viral infection,” according to the results of the Surgeon General’s 2014 report.
1:40 Italy, Spain ease restrictions as U.K. maintains measures Italy, Spain ease restrictions as U.K. maintains measures The novel coronavirus, which has claimed nearly 200,000 lives worldwide, over 2,000 being in Canada, is a respiratory illness that predominately attacks the lungs.
Many public health agencies have warned about smokers being potentially the most vulnerable to COVID-19, including the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which found smokers in Europe appeared to be more susceptible to breathing complications caused by the disease, as reported by Reuters. In Italy, which was once the epicentre of the outbreak, the Italian National Health Institute reported that the chances smokers needed intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation were more than double than that of nonsmokers.
 Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, made a plea herself recently.
“It is not yet clear if these exposures increase the risk of catching COVID-19, however, they do increase the risk of severe illness for those who get infected,” she said. “When you’re smoking or vaping, you are also touching your mouth and lips, this can make it easier to catch the virus from your hands.”
2:43 Hinshaw advises Albertans to quit smoking, drink less amid COVID-19 pandemic Hinshaw advises Albertans to quit smoking, drink less amid COVID-19 pandemic While the researches from the French study are clear that they’re not encouraging the population to take up smoking, Pipe said there’s still a chance of misinterpretation, which could have “unfortunate consequences.”
Ultimately, people are looking for a quick solution, he said, which they won’t find in this paper.
“It would be wonderful if somebody from a laboratory somewhere says, ‘hallelujah, we found that this compound blocks the virus from attaching itself to whatever, and here’s where we go forward.’ That’s the kind of story everyone’s looking for, that’s the kind of development everyone’s looking for, but science doesn’t necessarily work that way,” he said.
“And this is a hypothesis. It doesn’t prompt me to think, ‘gee, there’s an answer around the corner here.'”"
Coronavirus in Scotland: Death from COVID-19 results in over ten years of life lost per person, Glasgow university researchers say. 	"Death from the coronavirus will result in over ten years of life lost per person, according to new research from a Scottish university.
A team of researches at the University of Glasgow has taken analysis beyond the number of deaths, and looked at how it will impact humanity in the long run.
In an analysis published on Thursday, they say the number of years of life lost per person appear to be similar to diseases such as coronary heart disease.
“As most people dying with Covid-19 are older with underlying chronic conditions, some have speculated that the impact of the condition may have been overstated and that the actual number of years of life lost as a result of Covid-19 are relatively low,” explains Dr David McAllister, who is leading the research team.

“This new analysis found that death from Covid-19 results in over ten years of life lost per person, even after taking account of the typical number and type of chronic conditions found in people dying of Covid-19.
""Among people dying of Covid-19, the number of years of life lost per person appear similar to diseases such as coronary heart disease.""
They say this information is important as it ensures governments and the public to not wrongly underestimate the effects of Covid-19 on individuals.
The study reports estimated years of life lost due to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number and type of chronic conditions.
To conduct the research, the team took information from Italy on the age at which people with Covid-19 died, and the number and type of chronic conditions they had.
Their report, published in Wellcome Open Research but not yet peer-reviewed, states: “Among patients dying of COVID-19, there appears to be a considerable burden in terms of years of life lost (YLL), commensurate with diseases such as coronary heart disease or pneumonia.
READ MORE: 'Objects' better recognised historically than women in Scotland , says study
""While media coverage of the pandemic has focused heavily on COVID-19 affecting people with ‘underlying health conditions’, adjustment for number and type of long-term conditions only modestly reduces the estimated years of life lost due to COVID-19 compared to estimates based only on age and sex.
""Public health agencies and governments should report on YLL, ideally adjusting for the presence of underlying long-term conditions, to allow the public and policy-makers to better understand the burden of this disease”

Warning Against Corona Virus Racism Posted by Town Supervisor. 	"An oddly-worded warning to residents of a Hudson Valley community begs them not to react racially to the Corona Virus.
On Thursday the Wappinger Town Supervisor posted a message to local residents asking them not to be alarmed by the Corona Virus. In the Facebook post, the supervisor explained that even though the World Health Organization declared the outbreak ""a public health emergency of international concern,"" Wappingers residents should have ""little concern, if any"" about the disease.
The supervisor went on to urge citizens to ""continue with your daily lives uninterrupted in Wappinger."" Reading further down, however, I was caught off guard by a strange, final warning written in all caps. It said:
MOST IMPORTANT - PLEASE DO NOT BOYCOTT OUR LOCAL BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE OWNED OR MANAGED BY ASIANS.
This was a bit jarring, not only because of the all-caps but because I was unaware that this was actually a thing. Are people really not going to Chinese restaurants because of the virus outbreak a half-a-world away? I haven't heard anyone raise a concern about this before. There has been no mention of anti-Asian sentiment over the virus on cable news or in any written reports about the virus that I've seen.
It never even occurred to me that locally-owned Asian businesses would be risky. I still don't believe they are, but after reading the warning I can't help but have that seed of doubt in my mind now. If anything, I think this strongly-worded warning could actually make people more likely to avoid these places, thinking to themselves, ""Hey, maybe I shouldn't go to Asian businesses now.""
There's no arguing that the intent of this warning was good, but sometimes making a big deal out of something that most people aren't really concerned about only makes them fear it more. I don't know anyone who thinks the Corona Virus is a big threat to the Hudson Valley right now, but if we continue to loudly demand that everyone stop panicking, people may start to think that we may actually have a reason to be concerned.

Corona in Franklin?. 	The recent outbreak of corona virus in China and the six confirmed cases in the United States has caused concern with Health Officials. KOFO’s Jeff Brewer has more information.
Guinness scientists make major breakthrough on Corona-virus vaccine. 	"Alcohol scientists embedded deep in the barrel of the Guinness brewery at St James Gate in Dublin 8 have made a massive breakthrough in developing an anti-dote for the corona-virus. Guinness held an international press briefing at it’s marquee Gravity Bar this evening to announce details of their discovery.
Early on Sunday morning scientists in the company’s porter division made the startling quantum leap while testing 8 Guinness pigs that were injected with the highly contagious corona-virus.
Chemists administered the virus at 11 pm on Saturday evening and sent the test cases off to Copper Face Jacks on strict instructions to drink 6 pints of their traditional porter product, Guinness.
The highly controversial move drew criticism from public health officials admonishing the company for placing the general public at risk. However at 11:34 am on Sunday morning the experiment paid dividends and the fever broke.
Test case number 1 – known only as Porter Shite A – had a 15 minute dump in a highly sterilised environment but within 50 feet of the other 7 test subjects. As suspected the porter shite aroma killed all traces of the killer virus. An Garda Siochana have issued a plea to all patrons of Copper Face Jacks that may have been exposed to the virus on Saturday night to form an orderly queue outside St James Gate.
A member of the Washington Post enquired about possible side effects of the radical anti-venum.
” Apart from a short, intense reddening of the arse – Test cases are showing no side effects. We are hopeful to have the bottling plant at full capacity inside of 24 hours and start shipping worldwide shortly thereafter “
Branded as Proper Porter Shite No.1 – it can be administered as an aftershave ‘Eau de Jacks’ or in a starter micro farting 6 pack for 24.99.

Beating Covid-19 needs faith leaders to bridge religion and science gap. 	"While many religious communities have embraced physical distancing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, some still encourage gatherings despite strong public health messages that large groups run a significant threat of disease transmission.
Some ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in New York continue to gather for funerals, weeks after physical distancing guidelines went into effect in the city.
Four Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations have especially high rates of coronavirus infection, according to data released in early April.
Other religious leaders are using the pulpit to spread misinformation. The evangelical pastor Kenneth Copeland, for example, claims to have cures for Covid-19. And some Hindu nationalists in India have blamed Muslims for the country’s outbreak, leading to a surge in hate crimes.
As these situations demonstrate, millions of people worldwide look more to religious authorities than health officials for guidance on how to behave and what to believe in a crisis.
My research on the intersections between public health and religion suggests enlisting religious institutions worldwide will be vital in stopping the spread of coronavirus.
Connecting theology and health Social resistance to medical intervention often drives the transmission of infectious diseases, research shows.
Studying the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed over 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016, I have identified important lessons—both positive and negative—about how religious actors can help build essential bridges between faith and science to strengthen a pandemic response.
Bridging theology and science was imperative in the Ebola outbreak, when up to 60 percent of Ebola cases were linked to funerals.
Traditional religious burials in West Africa, both Christian and Muslim, often involve touching and washing the body, yet contact with body fluids spread Ebola.
For the first months of the outbreak, in early 2014, government prescriptions to cremate or swiftly bury the dead sparked fears and suspicion in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea—the most affected countries.
Many relief workers, outsiders dressed in spacesuit-like protective outfits sent in to implement these procedures in Ebola-affected communities, were blocked from entering.
Others faced violent, even deadly, physical attacks.
In late 2014, public health officials and religious leaders got together with the World Health Organization to produce a protocol for culturally sensitive burials of Ebola victims. Over 2,000 Christian and Muslim leaders were trained to conduct safe, dignified funerals in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The burial protocol may have saved thousands of lives, according to a 2017 study published in the journal of Neglected Tropical Diseases.
Faith and trust Among the assets that religious actors offer is trust—perhaps the most vital key in a crisis for addressing fear and misinformation.
After an initial period of doubt and confusion, when many faith leaders in West Africa understood Ebola as divine punishment for various sins or simply as fate, public health officials made a concerted effort to get religious leaders to the same tables as scientists to educate and engage them on health education.
By late 2014, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision International were organizing workshops that taught public health practices like meticulous hygiene and quarantining of people exposed to Ebola grounded in theology and scripture.
Like the burial protocol, such programs proved to be a crucial step in halting the spread of Ebola.
An equivalent intervention for Covid-19 might be a simple message focused on physical distancing, for example—framed by religious leaders in terms people can understand and accept.
Building bridges Any Covid-19 prevention program aimed at religious communities would have to work with faith-based organizations that know local leaders and have roots in the community.
But it is difficult to build partnerships between faith and health networks not accustomed to working together.
The Ebola outbreak demonstrated that relationships between religious and health institutions in West Africa were at best patchy.
Governments, international health agencies and aid groups lacked systematic knowledge about the region’s diverse religious landscape, which includes Christianity, Islam and traditional African religions. And little relevant public information was available to help them learn the ropes.
Ultimately, groups of religious leaders from various faith traditions worked through interreligious councils to help coordinate national faith responses.
On the regional level, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation leveraged their relationships with religious actors in West Africa to provide funding, supplies and training for Ebola relief workers.
The global scale of the will make it even more challenging to launch faith-inspired public health programs today.
I am part of one such effort to begin this difficult, delicate process. On March 11, the World Faiths Development Dialogue and Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University, where I teach, joined with the Joint Learning Initiative on Faith and Local Communities to document how faith communities are responding to Covid-19.
My project includes a digital repository to track changes to religious gatherings, beliefs and practices during the pandemic. So far, the database shows that religious communities are responding in very different ways.
Many Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities in the US are providing financial as well as spiritual support for not only the ill but also those who’ve lost jobs because the outbreak. Global faith-based groups like Religions for Peace are teaming up to provide support for vulnerable children worldwide.
But other religious groups continue to spread false information to explain the disease.
Hope for the future For health officials, figuring out which religious leaders worldwide to work with, who their constituents are and how to transmit health messages that will resonate with these communities will be tricky indeed.
But once on board, faith leaders can do more than convey health guidance: They can bring messages of hope to communities struggling with anxiety, sadness and despair.
On March 27 Pope Francis, speaking alone from the Vatican to a plaza usually filled with followers, urged Catholics to approach the pandemic through faith, not fear.
“Embracing the Lord in order to embrace hope,” he said. “That is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear.” Katherine Marshall/The Conversation"
Regional perimeter checkpoints implemented in northwestern Saskatchewan as COVID-19 outbreak continues. 	"The mayor of a northwestern Saskatchewan town is asking those who don’t live in Ile-a-la-Crosse, La Loche, or numerous First Nations communities not to travel there unless absolutely necessary.
As of Thursday, April 23, there were 21 cases of COVID-19, with one additional presumptive case. It’s a very worrying situation, says Ile-a-la-Crosse Mayor Duane Favel.
“We’re in the middle of an outbreak in our region…so what we’re trying to do is monitor the flow of traffic in and out of our region and offering educational sessions to people coming in and out – and really trying to get the message out there that we need to be social distancing. We need to be doing things in accordance with the state of emergency.”
A news release sent out by Favel, the Metis Nation of Saskatchewan, Meadow Lake Tribal Council Chief Richard Ben, and the local Incident Command Centre’s Rick Laliberte indicates the checkpoints will help minimize the spread of COVID-19. The region is predominantly populated by First Nations and Metis citizens.
There will be four check stops in the region on main transportation arteries in and out of the province’s northwest. They include Highway 155 south of Beauval, 963 and 903 fork at Cole Bay, the junction of Highways 165 and 914, and on the Fort McMurray access road south of La Loche.
Favel says all leaders want to minimize risk as much as possible. He adds that the majority of the people in the communities follow directives, but there is a small percentage of people who don’t or will not comply.
“So, we want to be able to take one step further to communicate with our communities and really strongly suggest that they need to follow these directives from the Saskatchewan Health Authority and the chief medical health officer to minimize risk to our vulnerable and our elderly.”
He adds that the healthcare system simply can’t handle a large influx of patients or those who may need critical hospital care.
“It would seriously stress the healthcare system in our region…we have a health facility in Ile-a-la-Crosse here and one in La Loche, and I’m hearing that we only have one ventilator in our health facility here and I believe there’s none in La Loche.”
Contact tracing takes a lot of time and if the virus spreads, the entire region could be in a “very, very serious situation in a short period of time.”
His message to those who don’t live in northwestern Saskatchewan: if you don’t have to be there, don’t go. Only those who need to access food or other essential services because they aren’t available in their community will be encouraged to do so.
“If people are coming into our area for things that we don’t deem essential, you know, we’ll be strongly suggesting – we’re not an enforcement agency, we can only offer and suggest – that if you don’t have to be in the area, don’t come in.”
An incident command centre has also been established in Beauval, and daily briefings are occurring between leaders. Clearly identifying certain homes where people are self-isolating because of the virus, or whether they’re OK are being implemented.
“A lot of smaller communities have implemented that in terms of green on a window is ‘I’m OK,’ yellow – different colours mean different things.”
Favel says the main message is that if someone doesn’t need to be in a certain community, who doesn’t live in the area, or is not accessing essential services, they’ll be strongly asked to return to their home. "
Beer brand Corona is willing to pay $15 Million to change the name of Coronavirus. 	"The deadly respiratory disease is scaring the people all across the globe but the repercussions are happening to the popular beer brand Corona. The company behind Corona beer, Constellations Brands, has offered up to $15 million to help change the Coronavirus’ name to the BudLightvirus.
The name ""coronavirus"" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo, which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles. They have a fringe reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona.
Executives at Constellation are thought to be ‘incredibly concerned’ with the rising publicity of the deadly virus, that has so far killed over 100 people and have pledged an initial $10 million to change the Coronavirus name to “literally anything else” with a further $5 million if the name change is BudLightvirus. “The name doesn’t have to be BudLightvirus we would also accept the MillerLiteVirus, the HeinekenVirus or even the CoronaIsActuallyReallyGoodForYouVirus,” told Constellation CEO Bill Newlands to CNN.
With the deadly virus catching the increasing attention Constellations Brands offers $10 million to change the name of the virus and an extra $5 million if the name is changed to the rival beer brand ‘BudLightvirus’.
“Well for one BudLightvirus really rolls off the tongue doesn’t it?” Constellation CEO Bill Newlands told CNN. “And when you think of a disgusting virus that forces you to cover your nose or mouth if you come into contact with it, you think of Bud Lite so we feel the new name is more apt. I mean how many people have died from consuming too much Corona?” he added. “Probably no one. Bud Lite however? Probably millions.”"
CHINA'S COVER-UP OF CORONA VIRUS SPREAD. 	"Piecing together the events in Wuhan shows that for at least three weeks before the banquet, city authorities had been informed about the virus spreading in their midst but issued orders to suppress the news. In effect, they engineered a cover-up that played down the seriousness of the outbreak, according to officials and medical professionals.
The most fateful consequence of the official silence was that it facilitated the exodus of some five million people in the weeks before the city was quarantined on Jan. 22, thus helping to transport the virus all over the country and overseas. Slow and sometimes contradictory statements from the World Health Organization, which is responsible for warning the world of public health emergencies, also hampered early efforts to combat the crisis.
Just as with China’s SARS outbreak that killed 800 people worldwide in 2002-03, the central shortcomings in China’s response have derived from its rigidly hierarchical political system."

Corona: A Twin Earth Case . 	"Remember ‘it’s not in the head’. We’ll talk about this toward the end.
The Ting Tings, a British musical duo, released a song by the name ‘That’s not my name’ from their debut album in 2008. This song is about a girl whose name people forget and call her by different names like Hell, Her and Jane. The girl reacts to it and says out loud, ‘that’s not my name’. After more than a decade, this song still seems relevant.
Corona, the Mexican-brewed beer, has been struggling to cross some unanticipated roadblocks since a couple of weeks, but at the cost of its brand equity and value. Ever since the news about Corona virus broke out, searches on the internet ebbed – about the virus and where it has been spreading. Surprisingly, people are searching with the keywords ‘Corona-beer-virus’. The searches for ‘beer virus’ jumped up more than 700% and the searches for ‘beer coronavirus’ soared to a staggering 3,200%, which is quite a blow to this brand.
It all seems stupid but somehow stupidity works at times. Maybe, its time for Corona to say out loud, ‘that’s not what my name means, for god’s sake!’.

This is not the first time something like this happened. In 2016, Tata Motors announced a city car by the name Zica but they renamed the same car just before its initial release because of the outbreak of Zika virus, which is a homonym of the car’s previous name Zica (derived from ‘Zippy Car’). Tata had some luck lurking in their pockets which helped them pull it off really well. In 2014, Italo Sussie, the Belgium chocolate maker, renamed their brand as ISIS but called off this new name because it sounds like one of the Islamic terrorist organizations (ISIS). In 1987, a diet candy which went by the name Ayds, decided to find a new name for itself because AIDS (which sounds like Ayds) virus was too serious to be ignored. These are just a few instances where a brand name made some irreversible changes to brands.
When such roadblocks appear in the way of a brand, does it mean that the brand is destined to fall into panic and take a break or rebrand itself? Maybe not. A brand’s name is as good as its brand persona. This persona grows over time. When naming a brand, brand owners deliberately try to plant as much sense as possible in the name so that it is pregnant with meaning. Amazon, Slack, Intel and Accenture are a result of such a thought process. Corona, Ayds, Zica also fall under the same category.
When a virus possesses a name, that resembles that of a brand, like Corona, the brand suffers misrepresentation. It may be because of the fear of viral contamination or precautionary steps of prevention. But when a tech-giant bears the same name as a rainforest which had been recently burnt down due to wildfires, why didn’t people relate the forest to a tech company?

Corona beer stands in stark contrast with Corona virus; and so do Amazon and Amazon rainforest.
The American philosopher Hilary Putnam has left an answer for this with his Twin Earth experiment.
Putnam says it [meaning of a word] is not in our head. He says we acquire the meaning of a word through the environment we live in. His Twin Earth experiment says: If there is another planet just like the Earth and that planet also has water like thing on it, but not exactly. For our understanding, we call it water because it resembles the water that is on the Earth. But, it is to be noted that the water present on the Earth and the ‘water’ on the other planet are not identical. It just possesses the same name. The meanings and references are entirely different. So, meaning of word is not in our mind but it lives in the ecosystem we live in. This linguistic concept answers the questions of Corona and Amazon too. Corona may be a refreshing beer for its consumers but it is a fatal virus for many others who do not consume it. The people who consume Corona beer may have surfed the interned just to be sure of its safety. Therefore, it is just a name that is living in two ecosystems, but with different references.
A multidimensional linguistic evaluation of a name is necessary before naming a brand. Shakespeare may have said ‘What’s in a name?’ We say, in a name, there are things that a brand cannot afford to buy, such as brand equity. "
Fighting Covid-19 in the spirit of Ramadan, Opinion. 	"Yesterday was the first day of the Ramadan, and Muslims are fasting.
Ramadan has always been a busy month, one which offers Muslims the opportunities to further enhance their spiritual development and for charitable acts. However, many of the traditional Ramadan activities cannot be carried out this year because, under the circuit breaker, gatherings in places of worship are not permitted as precautionary and preventive measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.
What were the scenes in mosques before the Covid-19 outbreak?
Muslims prayed in large congregations, with congregants positioning themselves next to one another, row after row, facing the qibla (direction of prayer towards the Kaaba in Mecca), united in the worship of God.
Until last year's Ramadan, mosques had been holding the iftar (breaking-of-fast session) with people sitting side by side in long rows taking the meal together.
Dignitaries - including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, ministers and MPs and others from the various religious organisations - have had the experience of taking iftar with Muslims.
Apart from preparing food for the mosque iftar, there was the cooking of bubur (spiced rice porridge) for free distribution to the public.
Muslims donated generously to meet these expenditures.
Usually, after the tarawih prayers - the special Ramadan night-long prayers - people would gather in a group to read the Quran, as reading and completing it during Ramadan is a blessed deed.
Anyone can join the group. Taking turns, they would read the Quran audibly, a section or two a night, until the whole 114-chapter Quran was completed a few days before the end of Ramadan.
The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted all these mosque activities. Now that Muslims cannot go to the mosque for the tarawih prayers, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore has produced a guidebook on ""how they can perform special prayers and practise their faith (at home) while doing their part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus"". The guide is also available online.

Many of the traditional Ramadan activities cannot be carried out this year because, under the circuit breaker, gatherings in places of worship are not permitted as precautionary and preventive measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Usually, on Aidilfitri (Celebration of Charity), large numbers of worshippers would throng the mosque for the one-hour early morning Aidilfitri prayer.
Then, from about noon of the day, Muslim families would start their silaturrahim (strengthening of ties) visits to the homes of relatives and friends, where food and kuih-kuih (cakes and snacks) are served and eaten together.
This whole-day exciting movement of people in new and bright costumes now will not take place this Aidilfitri - which falls on May 24 - as the circuit breaker has been extended to June 1. The safety advisory of ""stay home, observe social distancing, wear masks when going out for necessary tasks"" has to be adhered to for the good of everybody in Singapore.
Related Story In Pictures: Muslims around the world begin the month of Ramadan amid coronavirus pandemic Related Story Islam's holiest sites emptied by Covid-19 as Ramadan begins What Singapore Muslims would miss most is the Ramadan aura in the mosques. There is definite sadness, but Muslims have to sacrifice customary practices that encroach on physical contact and close proximity interactions during this emergency period.
Also, this is the time to show empathy and compassion to the unfortunate victims who might be of any nationality or religion; it is not for lamenting the inconvenience caused by circuit breaker restrictions.
People need to obey rules strictly to contain the spread of the deadly virus. The stay home advisory can be taken to show resilience in facing the calamity positively, and to experience a new but temporary lifestyle - such as working from home, taking the trouble to teach children in the absence of their teachers, and taking it as an opportunity to be closer to one's children, as well as paying more attention to elderly parents.
Related Story Muslims mark Ramadan with unprecedented coronavirus lockdowns Related Story Coronavirus: Support for Muslim workers at dorms during holy month of Ramadan The opportunities for spiritual development and charitable acts are not lost but, rather, can flourish while at home - fasting, performing daily obligatory and voluntary prayers, reading the Quran, making donations to charity, and settling zakat fitrah (an obligatory contribution by all Muslims in Ramadan) online.
The spiritual and charitable virtues already gained from past opportunities can be manifested in empathy and sympathy to those affected by the bleak situation - victims, as well as over-stressed healthcare personnel - through various contributions, monetarily or in kind, and from being united with all people in Singapore in fighting the Covid-19 crisis together."

5. woman who rejects motherhood is deficient, incomplete
My comments :
Of course men and women are physically not equal.
The average American male (20 - 39 yrs old) weighs 197 pounds. The average American female is 30 pounds lighter.
Usain Bolt holds the world record (men) for the 100 meters at 9.58 seconds. The very feminine Florence Griffith Joyner or FloJo holds the women's record at 10.49 seconds.
Florence G Joyner 1959 -1998
But those are physical aspects.
I ntellectually men and women are not equal either. A ll over the world women seem to achieve higher levels of education than men. And statistics do show that women have (on average) slightly higher IQ than men. This is a late 20th century phenomenon and is increasing all over the world.
In modern manufacturing female workers can outproduce male workers. The same applies in modern agriculture.
Males outperform females in heavy manufacturing and heavy labour like construction. Males are still better at lifting 50 kg bags of cement all day.
The world is constantly changing, and for a very large part it is changing for the better.
The right word to use is modernising.
Etymology of 'modern' - From Middle French moderne, from Late Latin modernus; from Latin modo (“just now”), originally modus (“measure”); hence, by measure, ""just now"".
Modern relates to measuring the uptodate status of something.
So it is very appropriate to ask questions like :
Is this the latest technology? Is this the latest version of this engine? Is this the newest design? Is this the most effective method? Is this the most uptodate software? Is this the latest surgical method ?
These are everyday questions which everyone asks. Why do we ask this everyday question? Because as human beings we need to reassure ourselves that our species the human beings are progressing. That our lives are improving today compared to yesterday. And that tomorrow will see more improvement than today. So we really want to constantly modernise. That is the key to our success as the human species.
So with reference to today, anything that does not provide scope for 'modernising' has to be Stone Age. Jahiliyah or ignorant.
Culture, traditions (including superstitions) and religion are not modern.
They seek to preserve the old (traditional Japanese sword making). Or they seek to be stuck in a rut (religion).
Hence traditional swordmaking and swords have no practical use to human beings. Other than displaying them on a wall or for recreational use (in a dozo).
What about religion ? Religion is the opposite of modern. There is no such thing as the latest, the newest or uptodate in religion. Religion is as uptodate as its age. If a religion is 5000 years old, then its adherents are dinosaurs. If a religion is 1000 years old then its adherents are dinosaurs.
There is no progression (modernisation) beyond the age of that religion.
That is why you see the type of arguments to justify forcing under aged girls to marry their 'rapists' or 'partners' in places like Turkey, North Africa and the Middle East.
These regions still suffer an overdose of religion and old traditions. Which means they are not modern. Without modernisation they have to be backward. There is no compromise between the two.
Of course I am talking about organised religion only. Of course I consider myself a thoroughly modern human being. Of course I must believe in an orderly way of life.

"""Bat"", the source of the disease, why is it not a corona virus ""human"" the real culprit. "	"Welcome to our Blog! ""Bat"", the source of the disease, why is it not a corona virus ""human"" the real culprit ""Bat"", the source of the disease, why is it not a corona virus ""human"" the real culprit Category: Blog Loosen the knot, ""bat"", the source of the disease, why never die Corona virus 2019 contacted the ""real culprit"" is not a bat ""but because of"" human ""skills. Mersars Sarsniph Hendra Ebola latest 'Corona virus New species in 2019 'for all 6 new diseases Caused by the same source, that is 'bats' For the spread of 'New species of coronus virus 2019' that originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, resulting in the number of people infected and gradually died. Expanded in many ways Countries other than China The source of this new strain of corona virus 2019 is from the 'copper crowned head bat' found in China. 'Bats' , mammals Some people call it the ""bird with mouse ears and wings."" Why is it the breeding ground for all kinds of germs that are harmful to humans. In addition, bats are considered to be a source of many types of disease. But why is ""resistant to the virus"" without any illness from the latent germs in this primitive animal bat ? These are the questions that many people are wondering. Bat, special animal source of disease but never ""sick"" The Thai Rath Online Specialized Team has an answer from Assoc. Prof. Dr. Prateep Duangkae, Lecturer at the Department of Forestry Biology, Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University. Which is one of the research team working with the medical team King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital In research to monitor the virus that can cause new diseases from animals to humans. By beginning to explain that 'bats' are a special animal group Is a source of various pathogens But the reason that it is not sick is not weak, that is because it is immune to the disease all the time Which is the evolution that occurred together Bacteria in the bat. If in the bat itself, it will not cause disease or show symptoms of illness. But if the disease is transmitted to other animals or humans, the disease will occur and show symptoms of illness. And can contact other organisms. Severe illnesses vary depending on the individual's immunity. Emerging Disease Cycle The real culprit is ""human"" and not ""bat"". Frequently found diseases from wildlife cause the germs in bats to be transmitted to humans. In fact, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Prateep argues that ""the bad guys are not bats"" but because of the increasing number of ""human"" skills to invade and destroy the nature and environment. Disturbing wildlife Makes it closer to humans Because they have to live in the same area as humans, but the most important risk factor for humans infected by bats is the consumption of wildlife ""Bats or viruses do not intend to spread the disease. The infection is with the bat, never mind. But when the incident occurs, change of address From being used in bats to other animals or humans, it can cause disease. Frequently encountering new diseases In part because more people To change the habitat of bats Blow up the cave to make cement. Changing forests into agricultural areas From bats that used to live in forests or caves Causing people to experience closer to the bat, ""said Dr. Prateep ""Thai bats"" without viruses, a new species of corona 2019 In the event that many people are concerned, ""Thai bats"" in various tourist caves Is there a new type of corona virus in 2019? Associate Professor Dr. Prateep clarifies that From the previously collected gray-crowned red-crowned bats Which is the same type as China confirmed that Thai bats have not yet found a new strain of the corona virus 2019, as is found in China. Cave visit There is very little chance of infection from a bat to that person. Because no tourist likes to catch bats Also naturally Bats and people will be different. Except in the case of intention to disturb Or caught to eat until bitten by a bat Causing the virus from bats to spread to humans Or transmitted through intermediaries from other wild animals that have been bought and eaten that may be transmitted through the process of cooking, such as killing, dissecting, dissecting, as according to doctors' reports. The chance of spreading infection is caused by exposure to secretions such as saliva, blood, urine, feces. Corona virus carrier to the Invisible Man Spread from person to person Because of mutation The current thing that Dr. Asterisk is concerned about today is the strain of the corona virus 2019. Once entered in humans, mutations in the life cycle of the virus occur rapidly. With cell division and conditioning Mutated to be able to spread from person to person carrying the most dangerous There are hundreds and thousands of wildlife species that do not care or vaccinate. Therefore cannot know whether that animal was bitten by a bat or not Favoring wildlife Which are not pets from standard farms, have disease tests, vaccinations, therefore increasing the risk of infection The Korona strain in 2019 is an emerging disease. At present, it is still not possible to say that the infection from bats has spread to humans. But based on the assumption that the first case of patients in China went through the market in Wuhan Which has many dead and dead wildlife carcasses Speculate that the infection is transmitted from animals to humans But still cannot determine which type of animal is carrying the human "" There is no bat in the market. But there are a lot of wildlife remains Be careful of the disease as a precaution, eat hot, medium spoon as recommended by the Ministry of Public Health. Try to avoid touching the bats directly. For wildlife eaters the most vulnerable, whether raw or freshly caught, there is an opportunity for each individual to not know whether infected or not infected. ” Assoc."

Christians in Wuhan Plead for Prayer as Deadly Virus Spreads A new deadly virus known as the coronavirus has infected at least 1,400 people in China, killing at least 41. At the center of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan. Wuhan is the largest city in central China with 11-15 million citizens. To contain this virus, China has shut down the city of Wuhan. The airport has been shut down and people are restricted from leaving or driving into the city. Schools, non-essential government offices, and most businesses have been closed. Christians are reporting challenges with lack of public services such as electricity, water, etc. There are problems buying food, supplies, baby formula, etc. The situation is desperate. The church has sent out a letter to the world Christian body asking for prayer. Translation of Letter from house church in Wenzhou: A public prayer letter from the Wuhan Church, asking the Chinese Church to pray urgently! God full of compassion and mercy, we lay prostrate before you and confess our sin. We have sinned against you, our city, our country, our compatriots, and we ourselves are short of Your glory. Wuhan and the surrounding cities have now been closed, and the spread of the virus has exceeded our capacity. The city is surrounded by the shadow of death. We, the covenant people who have received great grace, cry out to You oh Lord, asking You to forgive us for our pride, and ignorance. Our neglect has created this global disaster. Today, we repent for our sins. Please purify our hearts. Save us oh Lord from this great calamity. Forgive our sins and transgressions. Save us from disaster. You are the only one who can save us. Help us not to hide ourselves, but may we have a strong sense of social responsibility to serve the elderly and the children. We send special prayers for the protection of those living in poverty in the countryside villages. We pray for our fellow citizens of the city of Wuhan to prevent the spread of this virus. May they no longer take this situation lightly. We pray to you Almighty Lord, to send warm weather so that this virus has no hospitable environment in which to live. We pray that You provide protection over the other cities as well. Oh Lord, we remember the healthcare workers in particular. Protect them as they serve the sick. We pray for Your mercy Lord. Our bodies are weak and vulnerable like dust in the wind. May we come to you with a heart of repentance. Help us to preach Your message, remain upright and righteous before you, and lead a clean life with a transformed heart. Only You give peace and hope. Merciful God, You are slow to anger and abundant in love. Please remove this plague, hear the cry of Your people, and have mercy on the city of Wuhan. These are the prayers of the churches that the Lord loves, all in the holy name of our Redeemer Jesus Christ. Amen!

I documented a company called InOvio about two years ago. This same company have just been given 9 million dollars to come up with a vaccine for corona virus. They claim they were able to do so in two hours!
Local Biotech Company Developing Coronavirus Vaccine
A San Diego biotech company just received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals received a grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The grant builds on Inovio’s existing partnership with CEPI, in which the company was granted in April 2018 an award of up to $56 million to develop vaccines for…
NBC 7 San Diego
INOVIO The pioneer of DNA vaccinations is a man called Dr Weiner. This is the same man involved in the Zika vaccine.In 2000 Dr Kim and Dr Weiner began a company called InOvio, they first had a company called VGX.Dr Joseph Kim, teamed up with his university lecturer called Professor Weiner, who is the leading DNA technology inventor, created a few companies one was called Inovio, in which the Professor was the chairman.The DNA technology was first used on pigs, to make pigs breed at a younger age. Dr Kim was funded by Merck for his education, he produced something called PCV2 which is Porcine Circovirus, they were working on a veterinary drug that would help pigs escape a wasting disease.So this was evaluated by the Dept of Homeland Security and Plum Island animal research, this DNA plasma for pigs had approval in 2005, in 2009, the swine flu vaccines were filing for a patent.In 2009 Dr Kim’s company was filing with FDA to start trials on humans for the swine flu. Dr Kim has many Merck Insiders on his board. They created PCV1 and 2, which is Pig DNA. In 2009 Dr Kim’s company was filing with FDA to start trials on humans for the swine flu.Later on PVC1 and PCV2 were discovered in vaccines such as Gardasil, Rotatec and Rotarix.A couple of years after they were given the patent for this pig DNA vaccine using PCV2 that same ingredient was found to be in Merck’s Rotarix vaccine for diarrhoea and GSK vaccine rotateq for diarrhoea. Now how does pig virus magically turn up in a vaccine for diarrhoea?It doesn’t! It gets put there. And what is unbelievable is that even though both vaccines were suspended and it transpired that all the vaccines for 2 years had been contaminated , the FDA suspended them for a few months then let them carry on.(The Information about the two drugs being suspended was found on the Med worm website and the article was written by Dr Kim).Reports are now claiming that the coronavirus is linked to seafood after many people were reported to have contracted coronavirus from a seafood, 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR0Xe8TbDNKIeQzt9RyrJx3cBG_3K_lzvcO0VpEyGclmMXFxD44DwAzLcNg It has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste. https://abcnews.go.com/Business/consumers-eating-feces-tainted-shrimp-fish-seafood-asia/story?id=17491264&fbclid=IwAR1z3mxc7LXhEMnRj3pno5X3MStzO3IDuajsC7vdTNSSpultF3Uo7fjYVbY In early 2013, some 16,000 dead pigs (including corpses infected by porcine circovirus) ( which is really pig DNA)floated to Shanghai along the Huangpu river – a grisly sight that raised public concern about both unethical agricultural practices and water contamination. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/31/eutrophication-algae-how-animal-waste-is-turning-chinas-lakes-green
China has concentrated its industry on pigs in the area too. https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2018/07/05/Wuhan-pig-farms-to-organise-China-s-pork-industry
Prof Weiner is not only the worlds DNA technology expert but he is also a special employee and adviser to the FDA.
This shows the depths to the corruption of this industry when an advisory to the supposed regulatory body is also a producer of vaccines that he advises on!
He has perfected a new method of giving these DNA vaccines via Electroporation which is a electro magnetic pulse that opens up the cells, injects foreign DNA and then it closes.
The system has been stated by Molecular Biologists to be unsafe as it could lead to death or cancer.
They stated that only human antibody in genes is safe.
This is the same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the corona virus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology!
So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged.
They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.
Weiner was highly involved in the Zika vaccine.
It appears that they used the genetically modified Mosquitoes which had been irradiated and have had their genes changed so they can’t live to adulthood, they infect a mossy with gonad chomping parasite, which then affects a high proportion of insects and changes the sex of many, introducing anti biotic makes every male offspring transgender,they are making vaccines from these insect cell lines,this is what they are going to be using in the DNA vaccines, what if this was used with electroporation into human genes?
So here is a company heavily involved in experimenting on fake pandemics and fake viruses for many years, now been given the go ahead to produce the corona virus vaccine!
At this point, I would like to turn your attention to his partner, Dr Weiner.
An advisor to GSK, Pfizer and other Pharma giants, he is also a special employee and advisor to the FDA and the NIH grant review process.
No wonder then, how Inovio was given a 28 million dollar grant by the NIH to develop its genetically modified DNA based monoclonal antibodies and its new process of electroporation.
This is the process by which the very first genetically modified virus was used in this case, it was on pigs.
In 2006 VGX were providing HIV vaccines in Africa.
In 2008, VGX, which is also owned by Inovio, went into an arrangement to manufacture DNA plasmid for human use.
In 2009, Inovio filed a IND with FDA to start trials on humans with a DNA vaccine for H5N1.
Their lead drug for Swine flu was licensed in 2009.
In 2010, 8 different plasmids were produced in a study provided by the Defence threat Reduction Agency of the DoD.
In 2011 they were working with Homeland security on Foot and mouth disease.
New strains of foot and mouth disease began in 2012 in USA.
Under a research and development agreement, they were working with US Dept of homeland security and Plum Island Animal disease centre.
They were then given the go ahead to produce not only the Ebola vaccines but also the new novel method to administer them.
Conflicts of Interest
The Wistar Institute were given 9 million dollars to advance a coronavirus vaccine, the institute has Weiner as the executive vice president, who,s company will then make a profit from the vaccine.
THE METHOD
Electroporation
This is a pulsed electrical current applied to local tissue to allow the cell to have holes in it to allow just enough synthetic DNA to enter, then the pulse stops and the cell closes, the problem here is that according to studies, a manuscript in Molecular therapy with references from 74 separate articles written in 2004, concludes that the use of gene transfer using electroporation should only be used with human antibodies because problems could arise from cancer to death.
There is a brief explanation on how ‘recombinant DNA technology’ can influence “A HOST’S DNA” which is why this report was generated to begin with, as it looked into the ‘then’ Soviet Union’s capabilities at that time. A link here shows that: https://gdsajj.wordpress.com/2009/11/
Recombinant DNA encompasses only one area of genetic engineering; namely, Biospecific biochemical and microbiological to alter,relatively controlled and reasonably predictable manner, the molecules that encode the genetic characteristics of an organism, and to introduce specifically selected new set of genetic Instructions .
The specific molecular manipulations that are made and the exact methods used to make them can vary widely from one recombinant DNA experiment to another. The basic process,usually involves the Initial isolation or synthesispecific set of chemically identical nucleic acid molecules (usually molecules are then bonded…?) specially prepared vector (carriers) that usually are plasmids. bacteriophages, or other virus-like infectious entities that can self-replicate in appropriate host cells . After the bonding has been completed, the modified can be inserted into bacteria or other cells that lave been prepared biochemically to accept them. If the vectors have been “constructed” appropriately, the piece of initially selected DNA can give the recipient new genetic instructions. For Instance, the host cell might be given the capability to synthesise an enzyme that it previously could not make.
It goes on to state that:
This science is exactly what you would need for a population reduction ‘PROGRAM’ using ‘mandated’ vaccine legislation! Poisoning the well i.e. GMO food could also work well with this science achieving population reduction quotas. Link shown. https://gdsajj.wordpress.com/2009/11/

Beside the fact that Dr Kim has also served his five year tenure as a member of the Global Agenda Council of the World Economic Forum, which is clearly a huge advocate of a one world global government, attended by the world,s top 1000 corporations and involves a network of Government leaders.
We were informed via the mainstream media that the only way to test for Ebola was for those tests to be sent to UK/US labs, yet, a new piece of equipment had been produced that allowed those tests to be achieved in minutes, but, this appears to have been known and available since 2010, why has it been suppressed by the medical profession, it was part created by Wellcome, who are heavily involved in the medical agenda being played out.
I think the evidence gathered here brings a lot of scientific, military, bio-companies and government organisations into question on ethics and also on their real agenda. http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45/298.html
Inovio reportedly made the vaccine in 2 hours! A vaccine that takes ten years to go through rigorous testing?
So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged.
They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.
Here’s how this con job goes and although it repeats itself under different names, year after year (Corona, HIV, AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, Mad cow etc etc) most of the uninformed public react as programmed, simply because fear is PROVEN to trigger a narrowing of the mind, a lowering of IQ, a stimulation of the child ego (that looks for an adult to save it) and a reflexive obedience toward perceived authority.
The con job goes like this.
Step 1) poiso n the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally
Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person
Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave
Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated
Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere
Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.
How convenient
Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, 5G’s potential for remote medical services was largely theoretical , as carriers and practitioners spoke of the future prospect of performing remote surgeries or offering diagnoses to patients in far-flung areas. The use of 5G communications to enhance practitioner safety in circumstances such as this, where a virus’ transmission characteristics and other vectors remain unclear, is fairly new but represents a highly practical test of the high-bandwidth wireless technology. https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/27/zte-5g-gear-lets-chinas-experts-remotely-diagnose-wuhan-coronavirus/
5G technology also uses the pulsed mechanism of electroporation and the outbreak is in the same area that 5G is introduced? DNA damaging vaccines will be introduced.
In Oct 2019 a Global Pandemic Exercise took place involving the US CDC and the Chinese CDC which focused on a Coronavirus from pigs. This was hosted by the Gates foundation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm1-DnxRiPM&fbclid=IwAR1G1aQejmh9jSFZe2Cn7V3h1fMEPXDClrDwyzsyE6wVRloaRNuz5VExMAY&app=desktop
The patented coronavirus https://patents.justia.com/patent/10130701
The virus is owned by Pirbright Institute which is partially owned by the Gates foundation. One of the other owned is the African swine fever virus, which is listed as a “vaccine.” This is all about the vaccine s!
It is no wonder they have called this virus ‘Corona’ because this imagery has been showcased in every Olympic games ceremony for decades.
A Corona virus image As far as I am concerned this whole thing is a hoax, another fake pandemic on the way. The usual players are involved, they claim to have a vaccine in 2 hours, there is a mock up of the very same thing just a couple of months before involving the US CDC and the Chinese CDC as well as representatives from all the usual agencies and companies such as the Gates foundation , it gives 5G the opportunity to be showcased and seen as a great asset, it also gets a lockdown at a time when the public in that area were protesting against the incinerators that were causing respiratory problems, what better way to make use of the situation than to use it against the people.I also think that the pulsed waves of 5G have the same actions as that of the electroporation method perfected by Dr Weiner, the same man who has been given the contract to create the vaccine so it would appear that 5G pulsed waves would enable any pollutants to penetrate the body more easily and give the appearance of a viral infection. Dr. Stefan Lanka, virologist and molecular biologist, is internationally mostly known as an “AIDS dissident” (and maybe “gentechnology dissident”) who has been questioning the very existence of “HIV” since 1994. In the past years, however, he stumbled over a breathtaking fact: Not even ONE of the (medically relevant) viruses has ever been isolated; there is no proof of their existence.

Corona Virus: Leni Robredo Denied Entry Into South Korea. 	"Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo was denied entry into South Korea as she arrived to participate in the 2020 World Summit.
As Robredo’s private plane landed at Incheon International Airport today, South Korean immigration and health officers boarded the aircraft and ordered the pilot to immediately return to Manila.
Ironically, Robredo was among Rodrigo Dutere’s critics who claimed the Philippine President was not acting swift enough to curb the potential spread of the coronavirus in the country.
South Korea’s decision to deny Robredo’s entry was based on news reports that the first coronavirus death outside China was in the Philippines.
The Adobo Chronicles reached out to Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Boy Locsin and asked him if he will file a diplomatic protest as a result of the incident, and he replied: “Weh.”"

 Corona Virus and Holy Communion. 	While it is our faith that the sacraments are means of grace and not of sickness, they are physically ministered, and we should take physical care. As well as the specific concern about Coronavirus, this advice is generally applicable for all infectious disease. Wash Hands. Priests presiding at the Eucharist, communion administrators and servers are reminded to wash hands. We strongly advise the use of hand sanitizers immediately before the Preparation of the Table and Eucharistic prayer. Do not intinct. Because hands can be as much a source of pathogens as lips, intinction is no safer than drinking and can introduce germs into the cup. Intinction (dipping the bread into the wine) can also threaten those with certain immune or allergic conditions. For instance, those with gluten intolerance for whom traces of gluten can be hazardous are at greater risk when other communicants have dipped their communion wafer into the wine. Consider receiving Holy Communion in one Kind. It is Anglican teaching that to receive the sacrament in one kind only (i.e. just the bread) is to receive the sacrament in its entirety. The celebrant should always receive from the Chalice. Should a communicant feel ill or not wish to drink from the chalice then he or she ought to receive the consecrated bread alone. There is no need at this stage to cease offering the chalice to the congregation. The Peace . At this time there is no need to refrain from sharing the Peace. Possibly further advice will need to be given were the virus to spread widely in the UK. Visiting. Pastoral visitors to homes and hospitals should observe all precautions in personal hygiene before and after such visits.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Market. 	"The ""Biodefense - Global Market Outlook (2018-2027)"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com&apos;s offering.
The Global Biodefense market accounted for $5.47 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $8.85 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period.
Some of the key factors propelling the market growth are rising investment by the governments in developed countries and technological advancements. However, less penetration in developing and underdeveloped countries is the restraining factor for the growth of the market.
By product, vaccines segment is segregated into anthrax, antibiotics, botulism, E-Bola, eye shield, immunization vaccine, nuclear/radiation, smallpox, and zika. Anthrax segment is expected to grow at the significant market share during the forecast period owing to the increased investment on production and stockpiling of anthrax vaccine by government agencies such as the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Department of Defense among others.
On the basis of geography, North America is anticipated to hold considerable market share during the forecast period due to increase spending by the governments across the globe to develop and store sufficient vaccines against anthrax and U.S government implementing the number of initiatives that assist them in reinforcing security against biological threats.
Some of the key players in Biodefense Market include Xoma Corporation, Altimmune Inc, Bavarian Nordic, Cleveland BioLabs, Dynavax Technologies Inc, Dynport Vaccine Company LLC (DVC), Elusys Therapeutics, Emergent BioSolutions Inc, Ichor Medical Systems, Nanotherapeutics, Ology Bioservices, PathSensors Inc and Siga Technologies Inc."

Even as the confirmed U.S. death toll from coronavirus rose past 50,000, salons, spas and barbershops reopened Friday in Georgia and Oklahoma with a green light from their Republican governors, who eased lockdown orders despite health experts’ warnings.
Though limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopening marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging in the United States – and the world—as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically damaging lockdown orders.
Similar scenarios have been playing worldwide and will soon proliferate in the U.S. as other governors wrestle with conflicting priorities. Their economies have been battered by weeks of quarantine-fueled job losses and soaring unemployment claims, yet health officials warn that lifting stay-at-home orders now could spark a resurgence of COVID-19.
The coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including—as of Friday—more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.
New cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.
In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized personal-care businesses to open, citing a decline in the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19. Those businesses were directed to maintain social distancing, require masks and frequently sanitize equipment.

Still, some of the state’s largest cities, including Norman, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, were opting to keep their bans in place until at least the end of April.
Amy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the northwest Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.
“We’re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flack from people who say it’s too early,” Amy Pembrook said. “We just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.”
With deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to stay closed despite Gov. Brian Kemp’s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.

Kemp’s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for President Donald Trump, who said he disagrees with the fellow Republican’s plan.
On Friday, Trump signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic—the latest federal effort to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or scale down. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 U.S. workers.
Without a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.

In Georgia, David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments at his nail salon in Savannah, but a clothing store, jewelry shop and chocolatier that share a street corner with his downtown business, Envy Nail Bar, remained closed.
“The phone’s been staying ringing off the hook,” Huynh said. “We’ve probably gotten hundreds of calls in the last hour.”
Four women clutching face masks were waiting outside when the salon opened for the first time since March 26.
“Yes, I am ready to get my nails fixed,” said Alina Davis, a police officer for the local school system, who kept working throughout the crisis.
Meanwhile, Nikki Thomas is overdue for a visit to her hair stylist, but she’s barely ventured outside her house in the six weeks since she’s been working from home. She had no plans to change that now just because of Kemp’s decision.

“It’s obviously extremely stupid and I’m simultaneously exhausted and so angry I can barely see straight,” Thomas, 40, said in a phone interview.
The gradual reopenings come as coronavirus testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million people.
A lack of tests and supplies has hampered the U.S. effort from the beginning. About 193,000 people were tested on Thursday. That’s an increase from the two-week daily average of 163,000, but far less than what public health experts estimate is needed to get a handle on the virus.
Researchers at Harvard have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.

In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lengthened her stay-at-home order through May 15, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities like golf and motorized boating during the coronavirus pandemic.
Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to COVID-19, behind only New York and New Jersey among U.S. states.
New York reported its lowest number of daily COVID-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state recorded 422 deaths as of the day before—the fewest since March 31, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak.

Health officials in Colorado ordered the immediate closure of a Walmart in Aurora, a Denver suburb, after three people connected to the store died after being infected with the coronavirus and at least six employees tested positive.
In France, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be eased May 11.
In Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside.
The slowing of Spain’s horrific outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections."
COVID-19 pandemic impacts fertility treatments. 	"The American Society of Reproductive Medicine has recommended a pause on fertility treatments due to the coronavirus pandemic. For many in search of expanding their family, it can be a stressful time.
“We had patients who were even saying, 'Well I will sleep on the sidewalk if it means that they can continue with my treatment,'” says Dr. Williams at Columbia University’s Fertility Center.
Dr. Williams says his office is still seeing patients via telemedicine and is monitoring and treating all pregnant patients. ""New York state indicated that fertility treatment was an essential service and certainly we were able to put in a lot of measures and safeguards to protect our patients, to protect our staff and to protect our community,” said Dr. Williams.
So, for those patients who are freezing eggs and embryos, all patient transfers have been stopped. ""The health care system, in general, is stressed, so by structuring, by phasing in the way we open, to doing egg freezing and embryo freezing but not the transfers, we are able to get the benefit of helping those patients who would need it most and who would benefit the most without introducing the potential risks that might be present in pregnancy at this time,” says Dr. Williams.
He says there isn't an exact answer on when everything can resume again.

Is Belgium ready for new corona virus pandemic?. 	"Belgium is not taking any precautions against the new corona virus that has killed seventeen people in China. The Flemish Care and Health Agency says that the risk that a patient is diagnosed with the virus in Belgium is very small.
Joris Moonens: “The authorities are being vigilant. We are following the news and are getting updates from the World Health Organisation. Risk assessments are regularly made, but at this point we believe there is a low to very low of a patient emerging with the virus in Belgium. There is no ground for worry but vigilance is needed.”
No special measures are being taken at Brussels Airport. Many Chinese will be travelling home from abroad for the lunar New Year and will then returning abroad afterwards. Still, there are no direct flights between Belgium and the stricken area in China.
Joris Moonens: “Measures seem unnecessary at present.” The health care spokesman points to the fact that Belgium has a scenario ready in case the virus is diagnosed in Belgium. “We gained experience from another comparable corona virus outbreak in 2012. Procedures have been drawn up setting out what should happen when there is a patient in Belgium”.
Prof Herman Goossens of Antwerp University co-ordinates the PREPARE Outbreak Mode Committee that is funded by the European Commission. He insists the European authorities are ready: “Europe has the necessary structures and means to respond in the event of a pandemic. I have never seen such a quick reaction and co-operation as in the case of a corona virus outbreak.”"
Cepheid developing automated molecular test for 2019-nCoV. 	"Cepheid said Monday that it is working on an automated molecular test for the qualitative detection of the new coronavirus strain, otherwise known as 2019-nCoV. The test will be designed for use on any of the company's GeneXpert systems and is expected to deliver point-of-care results in around 30 minutes.
David Persing, chief medical and technology officer at Cepheid, remarked that ""we plan to leverage the design principles of our current Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV cartridge technology, in which multiple regions of the viral genome are targeted to provide rapid detection of current and future pandemic coronavirus strains."" The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test gained FDA clearance in 2017 for the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection.
Once finalised, Cepheid said it plans to access the FDA's emergency use authorisation pathway for regulatory approval and make the 2019-nCoV test available globally."
Van Jones: I'm someone Covid-19 could easily kill. Here is what I'm doing about it . 	"CNN host Van Jones is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) For decades, I used my social justice activism as an excuse to neglect my health. I took on cause after cause. But the whole while, I ate crappy food, rarely exercised, guzzled diet soda and rarely slept. I abused my body through stress and overwork.
Today, I am an African American man in my early 50s who battles high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and hypertension. In other words, despite being a tireless and formidable opponent of systemic injustice, I am someone whom Covid-19 could easily kill. The data is in: Covid-19 is hitting black America harder. I am not alone. This virus is wiping out black people like me in hugely disproportionate numbers . Read More Color of Covid: The racial justice paradox of our new stay-at-home economy If the African American community is going to beat this virus -- and create a pandemic-resistant black community -- we are going to have to make big changes in both our public systems and our personal lives. This virus is especially lethal to African Americans because it is -- in effect -- a pandemic jumping on top of multiple, pre-existing epidemics that were already ravaging the black community. Diseases like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and obesity make the virus far more deadly. And African American communities have those illnesses in numbers that are way out of proportion. Why are African Americans so vulnerable? Why is that? The reasons for poor health outcomes in the black community are complex. It's not just workaholic crusaders like me whose health is sub-optimal. African Americans tend to work in physically challenging jobs -- ones that demand much, pay less and offer worse health insurance. That's a recipe for bad health right there. Also, doctors have been shown to give us shoddier services, even when we have health insurance. Additionally, we tend to live in neighborhoods where the stores sell less healthy food; fast food joints and liquor stores provide too many meals in urban America. JUST WATCHED Magic Johnson calls out racial disparities with pandemic Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Magic Johnson calls out racial disparities with pandemic 02:56 There are other factors as well. Many traditional ""black foods"" boast much more cholesterol and sugar than the US Food and Drug Administration recommends. And to some African Americans, healthier choices -- like adopting a plant-based diet, exploring meditation, practicing yoga, etc. -- may seem culturally alien. While navigating the perilous waters of racial bias, and simultaneously attending to often distressed families and communities, it can be hard to prioritize self-care. All of these factors together make African Americans more likely to have diseases that make Covid-19 deadly. We need complex solutions -- not false choices. How can we fix the situation? Two familiar lines of thinking have emerged: The government needs to take more responsibility for ending the structural, systemic racism on full display right now in our health care and economic systems. Black people need to take more responsibility for our individual health choices. All too often, these two options are presented as opposing solutions -- or even warring points of view. And anyone who stresses #2 might be accused of blaming the victim and ignoring systemic racism. Celebrities unite to show support for underserved communities battling coronavirus But this is a falsely framed debate. We are not faced with an either/or choice. One can insist upon structural reforms, while also embracing positive personal lifestyle changes. I certainly intend to do both, going forward. After all, any meaningful improvement in black wellness will require major change -- from both institutions AND individuals. There's no question: The system must change. For an activist like myself, the need to change the system is obvious. Ensuring the health of African Americans means addressing the lack of access (food deserts), racial discrimination in healthcare and the epidemic of over-incarceration. It means confronting the legacy of structural inequalities that were devastating black communities long before anyone had ever heard of the coronavirus. African Americans and our allies should intensify the fight for these reforms. And we need to change, too. That said: we must also take more responsibility for our own health. And boosting our immune health must be job number one. The science makes clear that our lifestyle choices -- around sleep, nutrition, stress, and more -- directly affect our ability to strengthen our immune system. And at a time when the virus is doing disproportionate damage to our communities, we need to ask: what can we do as individuals to get ourselves and our loved ones out of harm's way? For example, we can all vow to eat healthier. Drink more water. Move our bodies. Process emotional pain through therapy, rather than comfort eating or substance abuse. Commit to a spiritual or religious practice. Meditate. Rest. Get more sleep. And let's not forget to practice gratitude. In the midst of this plague, every unlabored, unaided breath is more precious than ever. Black influencers set the agenda for global culture. We can make the quest for personal health as cool as we have made the quest for personal wealth. Imagine if rap videos and black TV shows started showcasing push-ups, Peloton and healthy green drinks, in the same way that they often showcase fashion and foreign cars. Black health & wellness already gaining traction. Here's the good news: there is already a vibrant health and wellness movement in the black community. (Did you know African Americans are the fastest growing demographic of veganism ?) Those of us looking to make even the smallest improvements may find that the guidance and support we need is already out there, from authentic voices that speak to our experience. From longtime practitioners and teachers to newer voices and advocates, here are some well-known ones: Jay-Z and Beyoncé: The increasingly plant-based power couple wrote the foreword to ""The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World"" by trainer and nutritionist Marco Borges. Jay-Z has also invested in black-owned companies that promote healthy lifestyles. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs: The rap mogul has joined forces with Arianna Huffington to promote sleep meditation through Audible.com. Common: The recording artist, actor and activist is a longtime pescatarian and former vegan founded his own nonprofit in 2004, Common Ground Foundation, which brings nutritional programs and chef workshops to inner city youth. Queen Afua: Longtime holistic health practitioner, author and wellness coach specializing in health accessibility for minority women and helping people build an empowering lifestyle through food, self-care and healthy choices. Dr. Joseph Michael Levry: A scholar, composer, author, and speaker, Levry brings together healing traditions of East and West. Food Heaven Made Easy: Wendy Lopez and Jessica Jones are the minds behind this food blog, podcast, online store and YouTube channel. They share recipes, cooking videos and nutrition tips teaching that making healthy recipes from scratch is possible. Jessamyn Stanley: A yoga teacher, body positivity advocate and author of ""Every Body Yoga."" Through her yoga classes, blog and book, Stanley demonstrates that yoga is for people of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds. angel Kyodo williams: An ordained Zen priest, the founder of the Center for Transformative Change, and the author of ""Being Black: Zen and the Art of Living With Fearlessness and Grace and Radical Dharma."" Through her leadership and writing, she is a leading voice in American Zen Buddhism. Healhaus: A black-owned wellness center in Brooklyn that specializes in meditation and yoga classes. They are live streaming classes for free in the wake of coronavirus. Toni Mitchell: A vegan fitness expert who posts recipes and workouts on her YouTube channel Black Mental Health Alliance: A powerful mental health resource for the black community. I commit to improving the system -- and my own health, too. The necessary structural reforms will take time to enact. But the lifestyle choices we make -- about what we eat and drink, how we live, how we treat our bodies and manage our stress -- can go into effect immediately. Big, racially-biased systems do limit our options. And yet even within those limitations, we have choices to make. I can't control the words that come out of any politician's mouth. But I can control the food I put into my own mouth. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter .
After this pandemic, the work of creating a healthier, more pandemic-resistant black community must begin in earnest. In times of crisis, when our very lives are at stake, we have to put it all on the table. We need to use every tool and weapon at our disposal. As for me, I am going to do a better job of protecting my own health and wellness. I will do so, not instead of fighting for social justice but so I can keep breathing and thriving long enough to win the battle."
BREAKING: A cure has been found for Corona virus - China Ambassador. 	The Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr Zhou Pingjian, says a cure has been found for coronavirus. While addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, Pingjian said Chinese scientists were working to develop a vaccine for the virus, assuring that the epidemic would lose its momentum in the next two weeks. According to him; “All things considered, the epidemic can be contained, controlled and treated. The Chinese nation has gone through great winds and waves and overcome countless difficulties. The 1000 bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan, which was built in 9 days and is in full operation today, speaks volumes.”

Corona confounds: The virus, the beer & some very perplexed Twitteratis. 	"With the world in the grip of fear of the deadly Coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan in China but is rapidly spreading globally, people have been searching for more information on the virus, its symptoms, how it spreads and how to avoid getting infected on Google. These have been among the top 5 searches on Google over the past week.
Even as the number of searches increases, a peculiar behaviour of the people have also come forth. In the past few days, there has also been a rise in searches for ‘Corona Beer Virus’. Apparently, people feel that the Coronavirus has something to do with the Corona Beer brand. These searches have been prevalent across the globe in countries like the US, Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan and New Zealand.
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&q=corona%20beer%20virus,beer%20virus,beer%20coronavirus
While there is absolutely no relation between Coronavirus (a group of viruses that cause respiratory infections) and Corona Beer (which got its name from its crown logo), the common Corona reference has apparently left several people confused. And where there are confused people, there are other people trolling them on social media. Here’s how Twitteratis have been reacting to #Coronavirus and #Coronabeervirus:
Scientists at @MillerLite Medical Research are recommending that all current worldwide supplies of @Corona beer be destroyed for the safety of the planet. #CoronaBeer #CoronaBeerVirus #CoronaVirus #China #CoronaVirusOutbreak #Epidemic #VirusChina #Beer #Diseases #Outbreak #USA https://t.co/gplGBO8XU8

— mustafa (@ahaamustafa) January 25, 2020 Imagine being in the shoes of the Brand Manager of Corona seeing this trend take over social media. Being involved in a controversy like this, even if unwittingly, is never good for a brand, especially when the disease in question has already taken the lives of over 170 people and could be a global threat. According to media reports, during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, sales of the diet candy AYDS dropped by almost 50 per cent. However, Corona Beer doesn’t have anything to worry about, yet. A post by MIT PhD candidate, Joonas Tuhkuri says that Corona’s stock price hasn’t been affected negatively.
Corona Beer's parent company stock has not declined in response to Corona Virus. pic.twitter.com/F7slJJTYm7
— Joonas Tuhkuri (@joonastuhkuri) January 28, 2020 One would recall the time when Tata Motors was forced to rebrand its Zica car as Tiago in 2016 because of the similarity of the name with the Zika virus outbreak at that time across the world.
On the other hand, Corona Beer has been in existence since 1925 and has had a long relationship with beer lovers across the world. Corona is known as one of the best beers in the world and has been propagated widely through movies like ‘Fast and Furious’. Talking about these factors favouring Corona, Digital Expert Karthik Srinivasan said, “Corona is a much older and established brand, while the disease is new. There’s a deep association set already with the Corona brand name, and I really don’t think it would affect them.”
We’ve often seen competitors take on each other while one is down. When Maggi was accused of containing lead above the permissible limit, other players like Yippee had upped their advertising and marketing game to create some “Yippee converts”. Will we see something similar in the beer game? Players like Carlsberg, Budweiser and Heineken might enjoy the idea of taking down a competitor. What should be understood though is that nobody would want to get their hands dirty and propagate over such a deadly virus. Maybe doing the opposite – helping people understand the difference – can create a good market image, similar to the Burger King and McDonald’s creatives. Probably that can take them a long way ahead, at least in the eyes of the people. Adding to this, Srinivasan said, “I really don’t think Corona’s rivals may try to use this in any way. It’s just terribly poor form to take advantage of a rival’s misfortune, particularly on the back of a deadly disease like this.”
It’s just disturbing to see how confused people are in the midst of the spread of a deadly virus having the potential of spreading globally. The Coronavirus has hit China at the time of the Chinese New Year, which means people have travelled across the globe before the government finally started detaining and isolating people to curb the virus’ spread. Digital platforms need to be used as a space to spread the right information, especially during the times of a deadly outbreak.
Leave Corona alone, enjoy the beer, and stay safe from the #CoronaVirus."

FYI… would be good to get some confirmation from medical professionSome effective ways to prevent the Coronavirus. It was originally written in Cantonese style Chinese translated to English. Worth a read.About the virus:1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who’s infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. 3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus. About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus:1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days. 3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It’s important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. About prevention:1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly lol).2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs."

Is China suppressing the corona virus infections!. 	Is China suppressing the corona virus infections! Is China suppressing the corona virus infections! New Delhi, Jan 27 : China is facing accusations from the world community of suppressing and playing down the coronavirus outbreak and the scale of infections which some reports say now I as high as 90,000 while the official Beijing figure is just 1,975. International media reports have said cited a nurse treating coronavirus sufferers in China who claims 90,000 people have already been infected.A nurse wearing a protective suit and face mask treating the sick in Wuhan has claimed that 90,000 people have already been infected by the coronavirus. However, the nurse's report has been viewed almost two million times on YouTube. In the footage, she warns people not to go outside and to refrain from celebrating the Chinese New Year.The animal virus epidemic originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,970 people and killed 56, and has spread worldwide. International critics are saying that the China is censoring the numbers and sanitising videos from the internet. China's President Xi Jinping has already warned of 'grave situation' as killer coronavirus accelerates.American cities are on high alert as two coronavirus cases are confirmed in Chicago and Washington while 1,000 Americans have been told to evacuate Ground Zero in Wuhan.Canadian authorities on Saturday confirmed the first case of coronavirus - a man in his 50s from Toronto.The countries which have reported these cases include Singapore, Malaysaia, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Nepal, France, Canada, the US, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.But the Global Times revealed that vital resources, including masks and goggles, were urgently needed. The accusations of a cover-up echo the furore surrounding the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002 when the government concealed the existence of the illness not just from the outside world but from its own people.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday declared a virus emergency in the city of 7.3 million, extending school cancellations until February 17 and cancelling all official visits to mainland China.China has quarantined three cities in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus -- encompassing a total population of some 35 million people.Other reports say several cities are under lockdown with a combined population of 47 million including Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Jingzhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Xianning, Huangshi, Dangyang, Enshi, Xiaogan. Jingmen and Shantou.Reports say that Wuhan continues to be under complete lockdown. Police have been stationed at the borders of Wuhan to block the roads preventing any sort of movement into the quarantined city. The city's pharmacies have been swamped by people wanting to stock up on medicines.
2019-nCoV - China's Mystery Illness Spreads. 	"You may have recently heard or read about a new virus that is causing a stir in the media. We wanted to give you a briefer on what is going on and if you should be concerned. The virus that is being discussed is called 2019-nCoV. It is one of seven known variants of the Coronavirus, which was discovered in the 1960s and is one of the many types of viruses that can cause the common cold, other types being rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza and RSV. Coronavirus gets its name from how the virus looks under a microscope, it looks sort of like a crown. The 2019-nCoV name comes from the date it was discovered (2019), n stands for Novel or “new”, Co stands for Coronavirus, and V stands for Variant. There are seven variants of the Coronavirus, four of which are commonly known to cause Upper Respiratory Illnesses (URI) and three of which are not commonly associated with URI symptoms. These 3 are some you may have recently heard about: MERS, SARS, and now 2019-nCoV. Coronavirus is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is a virus that typically starts in animals (the “host”) and can then be transmitted to humans. 2019-nCoV was first reported in the Wuhan City, Hubea Province, China. There have been less than 100 cases reported worldwide but there have been at least 2 confirmed deaths and cases reported in 3 countries: China, Japan , and Thailand . The two cases in Japan and Thailand stemmed from travelers who had been in Wuhan City. Most of the cases seem to be linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan City, but some of the cases have not been to this market, suggesting there is some human to human transmission. The two cases that involved deaths were from pneumonia that developed from the 2019-nCoV. Chinese health officials have shared the full genome sequence (DNA) with the National Institute of Health (NIH) so that it can be put in the GenBank, which is a database that allows scientists from around the globe to study different viruses. The CDC began screening passengers from Wuhan City on January 17, 2020, at the 3 major airports that receive travelers from this region of China. Should you be concerned: As it stands, this is a very small outbreak and is concentrated to a single meat market in a single city in China, so unless you are visiting this meat market in China you shouldn’t be concerned. In the bigger picture, though, we need to monitor situations like this as it shows how new viruses can seemingly pop up out of nowhere and start causing problems. If and when we get an easily transmissible and highly lethal strain of the virus, such as what happened with the Influenza Pandemic in 1918-1919, then we should be concerned and this is why the CDC and WHO continue to monitor cases like this.

Another chinese woman who visited Udr turns out corona suspect. 	"‘Embrace change & grow’ – says Pujya Swami Brahmavihari Das on his visit to Hindustan Zinc Another chinese woman who visited Udr turns out corona suspect.
Another suspected coronavirus tourist in Udaipur has health department in a tizzy as they rushed to screen the hotel staff where the reported suspect had stayed for a day. According to sources, a chinese woman had come to Udaipur with her three friends from Delhi on January 31 and they stayed in a hotel in Lalghat area here for a day.
They flew back to Delhi next day. However, the woman complained of hgh fever at the Medanta hospital counter at Delhi airport who has been admitted in a hospital there , her blood samples have been sent for investigation. Meanwhile, the medical department was alerted here and asked to screen people at the hotel where the chinese woman had stayed. CMHO Dinesh Kharadi and team did the screening on sunday. According to sources, blood samples of some of the staff have been collected who had come in close contact with the suspect.
Earlier, two passengers who came to Udaipur after having travelled with a medical student who tested positive for the virus in Kerala, had been kept in isolation ward here at MB hospital. One of them was a chinese woman while other one from Bharatpur. Both left the hospital and went to Jaipur without seeking discharge which has been taken as a serious security flaw at a time when the virus outbreak is causing global panic. "
Brit national treated Corona virus with ‘hot whisky and honey’ . 	"THE first British known to have caught the coronavirus has apprised how he beat the killer bug with a “glass of hot whisky and honey.”
No, not warm but hot whisky is what is needed, he said. Teacher Connor Reed is 25. He was diagnosed with the deadly virus by doctors in Wuhan about two months ago.
He went to hospital after struggling to breathe. Also, he had a bad cough.
Shocked Connor was kept in hospital for two weeks.
Connor, originally from Llandudno, North Wales, has lived in China for about three years.
He said: “I was stunned when the doctors told me I was suffering from the virus. I thought I was going to die but I managed to beat it.” “I used the inhaler which helped control the cough and drank a hot whisky with honey until that ran out. It’s an old fashioned remedy but it seemed to do the trick.”
He says, “I did refuse to take the antibiotics the doctors prescribed me because I didn’t want to take any medicines.”
Connor, moved to Wuhan last summer to teach English. He was discharged from the Zhongnan University Hospital in the city. He added: “It was only when I called back a couple of weeks ago that they told me I’d coronavirus.” “I’ve been off work and the boss thinks we will be reopening in a couple of weeks but I’m not so sure. Wuhan is becoming a real ghost town — there is hardly anybody in the streets and the shops are running low of fresh fruit and vegetables. And there is no medicine or masks left in the pharmacies. If you go out without a mask the police will arrest you.” "
FDA: Hydroxychloroquine 'not been shown to be safe and effective' in treating COVID-19. 	"The FDA issued a warning against the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus outside of a hospital or clinical trial.
According to the agency, the drug can cause ""serious heart rhythm problems"" in some patients, especially when used in combination with other drugs.
""Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,"" the FDA's warning read. ""We will continue to investigate risks associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 and communicate publicly when we have more information.""
President Donald Trump has touted the drug as an effective treatment for the coronavirus. While some studies with extremely small sample sizes have found the medication to work in battling the virus, there is more emerging evidence that the drug might not be an effective cure.
This week, the Veterans Health Administration hospitals released a study that suggested that the drug did not reduce the risk of mechanical ventialtion, and patients who took the drug experienced an increased mortality rate.
The FDA said in its statement Friday that the drug has not been yet proven as a COVID-19 treatment.
""Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,"" the statement reads. ""They are being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19, and we authorized their temporary use during the COVID-19 pandemic for treatment of the virus in hospitalized patients when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible, through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) .""
Patients who have been prescribed the drugs have reported that they're having trouble filling their prescriptions.
Doctors use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat malaria, lupus and arthritis. But since Trump began touting the drug in White House press briefings in March, the demand for the medications has skyrocketed. Patients who have been prescribed the drugs have reported that they're having trouble filling their prescriptions."
Corona Virus: AYUSH acting the pied piper!. 	"Corona Virus, AYUSH, CCRH and Homeopathy. Let us begin with a quote from our Constitution of India.
“It shall be the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform” .
(Constitution of India, Article 51A(h), Fundamental Duties)
The recent outbreak of Corona virus (nCoV) in Wuhan, China, and its spread has forced the WHO to declare a state of global emergency. Countries worldwide with their policy makers and medical professionals are trying their best to contain the spread of this virus.
In this scenario, the AYUSH ministry , a part of Indian Government, together with CCRH (Central Council for Research in Homeopathy) , had brought out an advisory mentioning that the Homeopathic Medicine Arsenic Album 30C as a “prophylactic” . It is also worth noting that, days after the notification, they were forced to withdraw it in principle due to the furore it created among the citizen of india, who were abiding by the above quote from the constitution of India. The AYUSH was in fact publicizing and withdrawing medicines, without any serious thought or by understanding the gravity of the current nCoV pandemic. This clearly objectify the incompetency of the AYUSH research bodies.
29/01/2020 29/1/2020 “ Prophylactic ” is a medicine or course of action used to prevent a disease. Now , both the AYUSH department and the CCRH has clearly demonstrated that it does not understand the depth of the meaning of the term “prophylactic”. We are living in a scientific era and science and technology has advanced to a very higher level. Modern Medicine has been very forthcoming in this matter in admitting that they do not have any specific medicines or vaccines against the current nCoV infections. Even here, The AYUSH failed to understand what is implied if it is said that “No medicines are available as of now”. They failed to acknowledge that, disclaiming is as important as claiming something, especially in situations like this. Also, it looks like AYUSH was indeed trying to proselytize alternative medicine by utilizing such a global emergency.
The question which arises here is: does Homeopathy has any evidence of the action of efficacy of Arsenicum Album 30C in Corona virus infections? Before answering this the AYUSH ministry must answer the following basic questions, which form the basis of any critical evaluation of any type of information meant to be used on a massive scale for the public health.
1. Where did they find the information? Did they hear about it from a colleague or friend? Did they find it through a thorough search of a database? 2. What is the nature of the evidence ? Does it report the findings of a study, is it a review of evidence or is it an opinion piece? 3. How has AYSUH come to this conclusion? How was the research carried out and what methods were used? Did the researcher make a logical argument? 4. Who has produced the research? Is the author an academic, a journalist, a commentator or an organisation? Is there a danger of bias? 5. When was it written? Is this old or new research? 6. Why has it been written? Who funded the research? Is the research aimed at a particular group of people? (Adapted from Aveyard, H., Sharp, P. and Wooliams, M.(2011) A beginner’s guide to critical thinking and writing in health and social care. 2nd ed. Maidenhead: Open University Press.)
I am sure that the experts in the CCRH are familiar with these procedures as they are the apex “RESEARCH” body for Homeopathy in India. However, their advisory clearly demonstrates that they have overlooked the basic steps in any research process and jumped into the process of suggesting the so called “preventive”, conveniently forgetting the fact that Arsenicum Album 30 do not have any published research paper which has a statistical evidence in showing that it has any anti-viral properties.
CCRH in this incident has exhibited a total disregard for public health and safety, a lack of prudence and utter callousness bordering on arrogance. Let us not forget that this is a publicly funded body which is being supported by the tax payers’ money and such irresponsible behaviour brings forth just one question:
DO WE NEED SUCH AN IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION WHICH DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF RESEARCH? HOW LONG ARE THE TAX PAYERS GOING TO PAY FOR THIS NOT ONLY USELESS BUT ALSO HARMFUL INSTITUTION? That is a question which not only Homeopathy Doctors, but also policy makers should be asking at this juncture.

COVID-19: Karnataka to start convalescent plasma therapy from Saturday. 	"Convalescent plasma therapy in the state is only for COVID-19 patients who are critical, in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or on ventilator support.
Karnataka will initiate convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for critically-ill COVID-19 patients beginning Saturday, state Education Minister Suresh Kumar, who is in-charge of addressing the press in the wake of the pandemic, said on Friday.
Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental treatment, injecting plasma of patients who have recovered from the disease to those who are still infected. This treatment procedure has previously been used for treating Ebola virus and Spanish flu patients.
""The doctors will collect the plasma of two-three such donors who have voluntarily come forward for the programme. Doctors cannot collect plasma from patients who already have certain comorbidities or are above 60 years of age,"" Minister Suresh Kumar said.
The process will first begin at the Bangalore Medical College where many patients who have recovered have come forward to donate their plasma. Based on the success, the process will be expanded to other COVID-19 hospitals.
Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Karnataka Medical Education Minister Dr Sudhakar said that the convalescent plasma therapy was only for patients who are critical, in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or on ventilator support.
This announcement from the state government comes after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) granted Karnataka permission to begin clinical trials for the use of plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 on Wednesday.
Minister Suresh Kumar had announced that Bengaluru-based HCG (HealthCare Global) Hospital had received the Centre&apos;s nod to conduct clinical trials on patients to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion therapy. This was after the Directorate General of Healthcare Services (DGHS) gave grants to the hospital for the study.
Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa issued a congratulatory statement for the private healthcare company.
Speaking to TNM earlier, HCG&apos;s Associate Dean Vishal Rao had said that the idea behind the treatment was to check if a healthy person&apos;s immunity can be transferred with the help of transferred plasma.
States like Kerala, Punjab, Delhi and Gujarat have started this treatment.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Thursday extended his stay-at-home order through May 30 as the highly contagious COVID-19 continued its rounds.
Pritzker's decree, which was to expire April 30, was relaxed to allow for some outdoor activities, many previously barred surgeries and medical treatments, and to allow some retailers to reopen to fill online or pickup orders.
While already strongly recommended, face coverings for anyone older than 2 will be required in public, both indoors and outside if the recommended 6-foot social distance can't be maintained.
“We are in possibly the most difficult parts of this journey,” Pritzker said. “I know how badly we all want our normal lives back. Believe me, if I could make that happen right now, I would, but this is the part when we have to dig in.”
The order is meant to keep people from venturing out and interacting in crowds, an easy means of transmission for the coronavirus.
Experts originally said the number of COVID-19 cases would peak by the second half of April and many predicted the number would be dropping by month's end. But Pritzker has said the peak won't come until May, requiring an extension of such efforts to restrict the virus's spread.
The original order came days after Pritzker closed nonessential businesses and shuttered schools for a period later extended through the end of the academic year. It allowed trips outside the home for reporting to an essential job, trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, medical visits or emergencies. Penalties for violations have been rare.
The state public health director reported 1,826 additional cases Thursday, for a total of 36,934. There were 123 more deaths, for a total of 1,689.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or modest symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe life-threatening illness, including pneumonia.
In Chicago, Democratic leaders supported Pritzker's decision, saying while the number of new cases may have flattened, additional protections are necessary until they are on the decline.
“This is a science-based consideration and we want to do everything we can to protect our residents from the terrible impact of this pandemic,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said.
House Republicans, eager to have a say in shaping a post-pandemic Illinois, offered their own ideas this week for relaxing the rules to allow parts of the decimated economy to reopen, many of which have been adapted for the new decree.
In a statement, House Republican Leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs took credit for those part of the extended order, which he called “the first step in moving Illinois forward.”
“Working together and implementing smart policy decisions will increase the safety of Illinois residents and allow our economy to begin opening up in an equitable fashion while still protecting employees and customers,” Durkin said."
Anderson University creates fund to help students affected by COVID-19. 	"Thursday, a new program was launched at Anderson University that will provide support for students financially impacted by the coronavirus.
""The Anderson University COVID-19 Relief Fund was created to remove obstacles hindering students academic success,"" said Anderson University Senior Vice President for Development and Presidential Affairs, Wayne Landrith.
Landrith says an outpouring of support from alumni and friends of the University led the school to creating a page for donations.

Greg Schiano takes a pay cut as Rutgers adjusts to COVID-19 impact. 	"When it the NFL draft and the SEC, it just means more players selected than anyone else. Again.
When it came to the 2020 NFL Draft, the only surprise would be if the SEC didn’t lead all conferences in picks. With all three days of the NFL draft in the books, the SEC did lead all in players selected with 63. The next closest? The Big Ten with 48.
This marks the 14th straight seasons that the NFL draft, conference-wise, has been paced by the SEC. The last time the SEC didn’t lord over the player selection meeting? Way back in 2006.
The only “blight” on the process for the SEC? They failed to break the record for players selected in a single draft. Of 64. Set in 2019. By the SEC , of course.
If you really want to show how dominant the SEC is when it comes to the draft, all you have to do is split the conference in half. By doing that, the SEC West’s 38 would finish second to the Big Ten’s total. And the SEC East’s 25? Those would be fourth, behind the Big Ten, its western counterpart and the Pac-12’s 32.
As for the other Power Fives, the ACC finished with 27 and the Big 12 21. With 21, the AAC led all Group of Five leagues. The others? Conference USA, 10 Sun Belt, 7 MAC, 2
Football independents accounted for nine of the 255 players drafted. Six FCS players were taken, while two and one from the Div. II and III levels, respectfully, heard their names called. LSU ties Ohio State’s record for players selected in seven-round NFL draft "
CPP/NDF-Ilocos: The new Corona virus is a neoliberal disaster. 	"Ilocos propaganda statement posted to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Website (Feb 1, 2020): The new Corona virus is a neoliberal disaster

Duterte attempts to deflect criticisms while people call for his ouster
It could be called a classic case of too little, too late but even that would be an oversimplification of the issue. What is clear is that the Duterte regime is now on a full-blown defensive mode after receiving widespread condemnation regarding the government’s mishandling of the 2019 new Corona virus (nCoV).
Worse Viruses: Irresponsibility and Unaccountability
The National Democratic Front – Ilocos deplores the Duterte administration’s desperate efforts to deflect criticisms instead of focusing on crisis management. After finally deciding to stir from unacceptable silence, Duterte spoke up regarding the virus that grips the nation in a state of near-panic. However, instead of communicating the government’s measures against the virus’ effects, he chose to dismiss the casualties as a non-issue.
In reality, though there are only two confirmed cases of nCoV in the Philippines, the death of the second patient is the only fatality outside China where the virus supposedly originated. And yet, he grievously delayed banning travellers coming in from mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong; that is, until the backlash was so great even he could not ignore it anymore. Before this, the best he could do was promise to hold a meeting regarding the outbreak a week after it started. Meanwhile, the people were expected to sit still.
Like a tyrant in a tower so removed from his constituents, Duterte does not understand that his ill-preparedness and belittlement of the virus itself is the cause for the people’s almost panic. He predicts that the outbreak “will die a natural death” as if he is a circus soothsayer and not the highest official of an entire nation. And yet, it was reported that Malacañang Palace required all its personnel to wear masks while any physical contact with Duterte was prohibited.
While Duterte vainly attempts to change the narrative, his trusted lapdog Bong Go spews tirades against those that criticise the government. Like a rabid mutt that has lost any sense, he wanted to quarantine a wide range of individuals—from those that justifiably called out the Duterte regime for its relaxed approach to the crisis to those who called for Duterte’s ouster.
Ills of Neoliberalism
On the other end of the defense line, the delusional Health Secretary Francisco Duque denied that the country has a weak health system. He reasons that the Philippines is “a middle-income country.” Hence, it is excluded from the World Health Organization’s concerns.
However blinded Duque is, the neoliberal policies that undermined the healthcare system are the same policies causing Duterte to tread carefully so as to maintain profitable friendship with the Chinese government, at the expense of the Filipino people’s lives and wellbeing.
Neoliberalism takes form in privatization of social services such as government hospitals and health facilities, among others. So-called aid from private sector is actually public debt.
Privatization is the exact opposite of making health services more affordable and accessible to the public. The Philippines’ leading cause of death remain to be diseases that are both preventable and curable.
In the same vein, Duterte’s onerous debts to China would actually be paid off through more taxes, not to mention with collateral Philippine sovereignty and patrimonial assets. And now, apparently, with Filipino lives. In true Duterte fashion, the beggarly president then absurdly blamed the Filipino people for being Sinophobic.
The Filipino people cannot rely on the Duterte administration to protect them from the nCoV. It can neither expect Duterte to own up to his own loyalties nor put an end to neoliberal policies. Thus, the mass movement in the Ilocos Region will continue to link arms with the rest of the nation in exposing and opposing neoliberalism that murders and displaces the people in ways more cruel than nCoV itself. It expresses its solidarity with the entire Filipino people in defeating the nCoV and using this issue as one amongst many for the ouster of an inutile and oppressive regime. More importantly, the armed revolution in the countryside will continue to flourish and advance in order to completely demolish the rottening system that Duterte embodies."
Is Corona Beer experiencing the AIDS/Ayds effect?. 	"“Gentlemen, we know the problem. The question is, what will we do about it?” “I have an idea, sir, but it’s pretty radical.” “This is no time for caution, son! Let’s hear it!” “Well, sir, what if we stuck the word ‘diet’ in front of the word everyone associates with a fatal and socially stigmatized illness?” “You mean, rename AYDS to Diet AYDS?” “Er… in a nutshell, yes, sir.” “My god. The boldness of it. They’ll think we’ve gone mad. But perhaps it’s just crazy enough to work.”
They should have gone with Ayds Lite instead. Then everyone would have known it wasn’t as bad as regular Ayds. 3 Likes January 27, 2020, 7:12pm #9
I remember their brilliant announcement that Antrax were going to change their name to ‘Basket Full of Puppies’
‘In light of current events, we are changing the name of the band to something more friendly, “Basket Full Of Puppies”… In the twenty years we’ve been known as “Anthrax”, we never thought the day would come that our name would actually mean what it really means… Before the tragedy of September 11th the only thing scary about Anthrax was our bad hair in the 80’s and the “Fistful Of Metal” album cover. Most people associated the name Anthrax with the band, not the germ. Now in the wake of those events, our name symbolizes fear, paranoia and death. Suddenly our name is not so cool. To be associated with these things we are against is a strange and stressful situation.’ 6 Likes January 27, 2020, 7:22pm #10
I have a very clear memory from when I was an early teen(mostly white suburbia town near San Diego), walking into the local grocery store, and hearing a news report over the store “musak” about Ayds and how it had killed a number of more people…AND i can also clearly remember thinking to myself at the time, “You know, they really should remove that diet supplement from the market if it’s killing so many people.”
It would be a few weeks more before I read an article in the paper discussing AIDS and the epidemic that was occurring outside my sheltered existence. It became more sobering when I talked with my mom(a labor and delivery nurse at a hospital in a lower income part of San Diego) and the beginning impacts at her work.
I haven’t thought about this in so many many years, but it’s still so clear in my head. I think that was the beginning of the end of my childhood. "
RI-Based Branding Agency J&R Marketing Launches Effort Aiming to Support Small Businesses Impacted by COVID-19. 	"The initiative, Support4Corona, creatively generates revenue for local businesses through personalized apparel designs.
While folks across the globe continue to weather the unprecedented storm that is COVID-19, Rhode Island’s economy has been hit especially hard. With 53% of Rhode Island’s workers employed by the state’s 98,000 small businesses, Governor Raimondo’s non-essential shutdown has left uncertainty for the future of many entrepreneurs and workers.
But you’ve been hearing enough negativity lately, so here’s some good news .
The team at J&R Marketing , a local digital marketing & branding agency with a particular expertise in custom apparel, is using their printing prowess to help small businesses and organizations get crafty and generate alternative revenue while their doors are closed. Through Support4Corona , J&R Marketing is helping businesses design and launch apparel, whose profits will go directly to the Cause.
“The process is really simple” says Operations Manager Brittany Magnusson, “you get started by letting us know which Cause you’ll be supporting, whether that’s a business, charity, your company or other organization.

[Russo] is an entrepreneur, so he understands how much this means to the small business community. We‘ve been smacked by this virus, so even the sale of some hats or t-shirts will be infinitely helpful right now.”
According to their website, www.support4corona.com, there is no “magic number” when it comes to target sales or Causes helped throughout this initiative. With no certain end date to the COVID-19 non-essential shutdown, Russo promises that this initiative will go on “for as long as our local businesses need the help.”

Deadly Chemical Corona Virus. 	"In early January 2020 the world was stirred by a new variant of the virus called the Corona virus. The shape and size of the virus
Wikipedia states that coronavirus is a virus from the coronaviridae family. This virus is round. While its size must be very microscopic, even this virus cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope because it is so small. We know that the page virus can attack bacteria and even destroy it and duplicate itself into a lot of juveniles of the virus.
We know that the virus is obligate or pure parasitic, meaning that it can live only by hitching a ride on its host. Viruses are also known to have the ability to survive in crystal conditions or die when not in or not infecting their host. There are so many types of viruses that we know for example are influenza viruses, hepatitis viruses, herpes viruses and HIV viruses.
Viruses compared to bacteria are more dangerous viruses because there are some bacteria that are good bacteria while viruses are all pathogenic or can cause disease. Many diseases caused by viruses can not even be treated, for example, HIV AIDS.
In Wuhan City, China was reported to have detected the Corona virus and claimed the lives of humans infected by this virus. The corona virus is thought to have the same resemblance to the SARS virus and is very deadly.
It was also reported that the Corona virus could move from a human host to another human without animal intermediaries. But it was stated that this corona virus was found in bats.
Symptoms of contracting Corona virus
One of the most obvious symptoms when humans are exposed to the Corona virus is an increase in body temperature or fever in the respiratory tract and infection or inflammation in the lungs. The name of this disease is often called pneumonia wuhan. This virus was also declared very resistant to antibiotics.
It was also stated that this virus could mutate into a more virulent virus. This mutation can be caused by natural factors due to climate change for example or because of mutations by genetic engineering made by humans in the laboratory or often termed as biochemical weapons. Not surprisingly, at this time America and China are in conflict, as well as with other regions including Iran. It is feared because now it is happening Hot atmosphere among the superpower countries in the world may also be a cold war in the form of chemical weapons war. Indonesia as a non-aligned country, although not in favor of any country, but if for example the super power state had an argument and there was a third world war, it would not be denied that Indonesia would be the victim.
Reportedly at this time the Corona virus has entered Indonesia through tourists entering Indonesia via air transportation. It was also reported that one of the foreign nationals was quarantined in one of the buildings in Jakarta because of the Corona virus. One way to detect that a person, especially a foreign citizen who entered Indonesia, was infected by the Corona virus or not, is to use a heat detector. In crowded centers such as airports and / or ports installed heat detection devices on humans and will be seen if the human has a fever then it is immediately checked whether the human has a normal fever or the fever is caused by the Corona virus.
We pray that our family and our nation will avoid the danger of this very deadly virus, the corona virus and other types of viruses used as material for biochemical weapons. one of the prevention is by drinking or eating foods containing vitamin C, exercising and checking the body when experiencing high fever to the doctor or to the nearest hospital "
Two states ease lockdowns; US COVID-19 toll passes 50,000. 	"Even as the confirmed U.S. death toll from coronavirus rose past 50,000, salons, spas and barbershops reopened Friday in Georgia and Oklahoma with a green light from their Republican governors, who eased lockdown orders despite health experts' warnings.
Though limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopening marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging in the United States – and the world -- as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically damaging lockdown orders.
Similar scenarios have been playing worldwide and will soon proliferate in the U.S. as other governors wrestle with conflicting priorities. Their economies have been battered by weeks of quarantine-fueled job losses and soaring unemployment claims, yet health officials warn that lifting stay-at-home orders now could spark a resurgence of COVID-19.
The coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including - as of Friday - more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.
New cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.
In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized personal-care businesses to open, citing a decline in the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19. Those businesses were directed to maintain social distancing, require masks and frequently sanitize equipment.
Still, some of the state’s largest cities, including Norman, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, were opting to keep their bans in place until at least the end of April.
Amy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the northwest Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.
“We’re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flack from people who say it’s too early,"" Amy Pembrook said. ""We just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.”
With deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to stay closed despite Gov. Brian Kemp’s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.
Kemp’s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for President Donald Trump, who said he disagrees with the fellow Republican’s plan.
On Friday, Trump signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic - the latest federal effort to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or scale down. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 U.S. workers.
Without a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.
Kids still attend soccer practice in Sweden while they are not even allowed outside in Spain. As governments and scientists fumble around, still struggling with so many unknowns, individuals are being left to take potentially life-affecting decisions.
In Georgia, David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments at his nail salon in Savannah, but a clothing store, jewelry shop and chocolatier that share a street corner with his downtown business, Envy Nail Bar, remained closed.
“The phone’s been staying ringing off the hook,” Huynh said. “We’ve probably gotten hundreds of calls in the last hour.”
Four women clutching face masks were waiting outside when the salon opened for the first time since March 26.
“Yes, I am ready to get my nails fixed,” said Alina Davis, a police officer for the local school system, who kept working throughout the crisis.
Meanwhile, Nikki Thomas is overdue for a visit to her hair stylist, but she’s barely ventured outside her house in the six weeks since she's been working from home. She had no plans to change that now just because of Kemp’s decision.
“It’s obviously extremely stupid and I’m simultaneously exhausted and so angry I can barely see straight,” Thomas, 40, said in a phone interview.
The gradual reopenings come as coronavirus testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million people.
A lack of tests and supplies has hampered the U.S. effort from the beginning. About 193,000 people were tested on Thursday. That’s an increase from the two-week daily average of 163,000, but far less than what public health experts estimate is needed to get a handle on the virus.
Researchers at Harvard have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.
In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lengthened her stay-at-home order through May 15, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities like golf and motorized boating during the coronavirus pandemic.
Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to COVID-19, behind only New York and New Jersey among U.S. states.
New York reported its lowest number of daily COVID-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state recorded 422 deaths as of the day before - the fewest since March 31, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak.
In Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock extended the city’s stay-at-home order and non-essential business closures through May 8 just as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a fellow Democrat, prepared to relax some statewide restrictions next week.
Health officials in Colorado ordered the immediate closure of a Walmart in Aurora, a Denver suburb, after three people connected to the store died after being infected with the coronavirus and at least six employees tested positive.
In France, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be eased May 11.
In Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside.
The slowing of Spain’s horrific outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections."
Corona Virus — A Bad Feeling. 	"My Spider Sense (which is stronger than 100 acres of garlic) is tingling as the world deals with the Corona Virus. Here is a depiction of the culprit. Ugly bug, no?
There is no evidence that the Corona Virus is spread by Corona Beer, though considerable research continues on this logical connection. If I were not so spooked by Mexico these days, I would take a sabbatical to study it myself. Why is your Spider Sense tingling, Big Red Car?
I don’t trust the Chinese about anything. I think the Chinese are under reporting the size of the pandemic because of national pride.
It is clear this is a huge problem as the virus is being systematically distributed to the world — now being found in the United States, England, France, Thailand, Australia, Germany, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Nepal, Finland, Cambodia, India, Singapore, and Russia.
Ahh, the wonders and benefits of air travel.
The World Health Organization has declared a “global emergency threat.”
Chinese President for Life +10 Years Xi Jinping has called it a “demon” virus, a “demon” epidemic. [Note: The simple fact that Xi Jinping commented on the Corona Virus tells you something.]
The numbers are moving quickly — quicker than it is possible to report them. There are an admitted more than 10,000 Chinese infected and more than 200 deaths.
My Spider Sense says those numbers could be 100,000 infected and 10,000 dead. China has locked down 60,000,000 persons in the Wuhan area. Seems a big move. What’s the Big Deal, Big Red Car?
The Big Deal is caused by the lack of real information as to what the Corona Virus actually is.
Symptoms are said to be cough, fever, shortness of breath, but field reports say it may have very little symptoms and still be communicable.
Big Pharma says it can produce a vaccine, but it will take a year or more to deliver. They have already been able to grow the CV in the lab — huge milestone. Meanwhile, they are trying out some promising HIV drugs that they speculate may be effective.
So, right now if you get infected, you have to treat the symptoms and ride it out.
The other troubling development was the recognition that it could be transmitted from person-to-person. That is not completely novel, but taken with the fact that symptoms may not show up for 14 days, this is a real complication. Perspective, Big Red Car?
Yes, dear reader, we need some perspective, don’t we? Let me share some info as it relates to influenza in the United States. I like to look at the flu numbers because it is almost completely avoidable by receiving a damn flu shot. Hello, America? Flu shots?
These US numbers are only for the time period of 1 October 2019 to 20 January 2020. They are illuminating. Total cases of flu: 19-26,000,000 <<< the US population is 330,000,000 Total flu medical visits: 9-12,000,000 Total flu hospitalizations: 180-310,000 Flu deaths: 10-25,000 <<< fewer than 8,000 US military KIAs total in Iraq and Afghanistan
This info is based on a mathematical model founded on actual collected data through the US Center for Disease Control’s US Influenza Surveillance System.
As you can see, the flu in the US this winter is a Big Deal. Bottom line it, Big Red Car
So, here’s the bottom line.
The world is dealing with an unknown that is difficult to detect, has a 14-day incubation period, is transmittable person-to-person, may not show its symptoms clearly, and is becoming widely spread around the world. It appears to have a 2% mortality rate.
Countries are closing borders, evacuating nationals from China, cancelling flights to China, quarantining travelers for 14 days, and monitoring the situation with great concern whilst Big Pharma says it will take a year to develop a vaccine and that is a crap shoot.
BTW, for you capitalists: The Corona Virus has knocked the Dow down, but it will also drive jobs back to the United States. An ill wind blows good?
I will not be eating Chinese food this weekend though I cannot imagine I am at risk with sweet-sour soup and a couple of shrimp rolls?
My Spider Sense tells me this one is different. Different than SARS (10% mortality rate), MERS, the Swine Flu, Ebola (90% mortality rate). I think China is not leveling with us.
Be careful out there, amigos. Be very careful. Wash your hands, carry hand sanitizer, be very, very, very careful. Hedge your bets, PRAY.
But, hey, what the Hell do I really know anyway? I’m just a Big Red Car. Be well. This entry was posted in America , China and tagged Corona , Corona Beer , Corona Virus . Bookmark the permalink . Post navigation"
The Corona Virus … who to believe?. 	"I’ve refrained from commenting much on this issue because really if you’re observing developments in light of the bigger scheme of things, well it’s hard to know who is telling the truth these days. We have a lying, bought whore media , lying in other ranks, a history of creating viruses in labs that are patented!! So much untruth. We hear also of firemen being held back from attending fires (run by UN now apparently) and no will to employ geoengineering tech and put out the Aussie fires. Then we have the Police deciding not to send help to the Whakaari/White Is eruption victims but taking credit later even when it was Joe Public who went to their help, and I haven’t even mentioned all of the 1080 anomalies in our Court system even. It’s all coming to light quite plainly of late the lying. Add to that the heavy censorship going on of all things truth. Recently Facebook that is doubling down on all independent info & truth, they removed a post of mine by a Harvard immunologist. They are not even smart enough to remove something that maybe looks fake … but a Harvard immunologist? That alone tells what people will swallow without question. Problem with the post was she was talking about vaccines and the unvaccinated posing no risk, and of course the truth on that topic is bursting out so wildly they’ve got the WHO vaccine safety folks scrambling for some good answers to give those pesky inquiring parents who weirdly enough want to protect their children from injury. One in 39 according to CDC’s own stats are injured. Who would want to take that very high risk yet they are pushing for mandatory? Then we have the NZ Vaccinologist telling us that strange line that SARS and MERS viruses were set up to kill a lot more people … very weird isn’t it? And yes, we’re now hearing there’s a vaccine coming. They’re working on it.
Doesn’t that make you feel really really safe?
Anyway, all that said, in my trawling through the various news sources on the CV I note that the Fullerton Informer has a good overview that’s the best I’ve heard yet. Listen below and make up your own mind … details on the video can be found by clicking on the YT icon bottom right of the video screen taking you to YT.
Aside from all discussions, truths or untruths, I believe it’s always wisest (as with the 1080 issue) to take the precautionary approach. Your corporations parading as governments are not doing that … they are not testing 5G for instance (nor heeding the independent science) and unleashing it on you anyway so YOU are the test case. They do this with vaccines & pharmaceuticals as well. No LT studies or proof of safety required (as happened with glyphosate in Roundup) plus in the case of vaccines have been protected as industries from any kickback should you want to sue them. Protect yourself therefore, going by the info that you have, particularly the independent info, from reliable sources of course. Cover all bases. You’ve nothing to lose in doing that. Have a read below the video of Jim Humble’s recent spiel. (Thanks to NZ Rose for that info). His is very helpful advice. EWR “Hello, Some of you have written asking for my thoughts on the latest coronavirus which is making headlines these days. To start, here is one definition of coronavirus: Coronaviruses are types of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans. They are associated with the common cold, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and can also affect the gut. News agencies report that the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China is rapidly evolving and reportedly (at the time of this writing),infections from the virus have now been found on other continents and several other countries in Asia have reported cases as well. Signs of the virus are fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath—however, it has been reported that some carriers of this strain of coronavirus show no respiratory symptoms at all. This makes it extremely difficult to detect carriers of the virus, taking into account that health officials are looking for respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and breathing difficulties. Another report said some carriers have no fever and no coughing, but instead are exhibiting symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and chest pains. At the time of writing this, statistics vary according to the news as to how many confirmed cases there are worldwide, as well as deaths. It has been reported that China is moving to restrict travel and schools in Hong Kong and the mainland are postponing classes. Some say the situation is far worse than what is being reported, others suggest it is a hoax. The purpose of this newsletter is not to analyze or speculate what is behind all of this, or try to project where it is all going. As most would agree, we live in very unique times—whether you believe this and other similar outbreaks are part of a great conspiracy, or signs of the times according to Biblical predictions, or whatever other reason—I would like to say, it’s a good time to have some MMS on hand and educate yourself in its use. MMS (sodium chlorite activated with a food grade acid which then produces chlorine dioxide) kills most of the diseases of mankind. I don’t know for sure about the coronavirus at this time—but we know that MMS kills viruses as well as pathogens of all kinds and is an immune system builder. There is much anecdotal evidence that says MMS has proven very effective in eradicating viruses including Ebola, Swine Flu, TB, and other respiratory diseases. Chlorine dioxide was completely effective against Anthrax in 2001, and used by US Military for Ebola in 2014. It’s been proven by the Red Cross in 2012 to eradicate malaria in just four hours, to name a few. I have been receiving feedback for over 22 years from people all around the world who have given testimony of how they recovered their health from a vast variety of disease, many life-threatening, with MMS. Therefore, I have every reason to believe it can be effective in stopping and preventing the current novel coronavirus going around today. For more information and some important facts on MMS, as well as the history of MMS, go here: Important Facts Regarding MMS ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur … ) Again, I have reason to believe, MMS (chlorine dioxide), can be very effective in both preventing and eradicating the coronavirus. With the barrage of health issues in the world today, I would say, let MMS be your first line of defense. Why not be prepared for whatever may come your way? It’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. The point is, we never know when an emergency or “outbreak” of some illness is going to happen. Weather it is a stroke, or a heart attack, an accident or this year’s epidemic. We need to be prepared ahead of time and not wait until it’s too late. A great way to prepare is to educate yourself on MMS. The best way you can do this, in my opinion, is get the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, available here: jhbooks.org ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur … ) This book is a clear and concise guide to all you need to know in order to recover health with MMS, as well as how to strengthen your immune system by staying overall toxin free. So get the Guidebook, study it, familiarize yourself with it and have MMS on hand. Regarding the coronavirus, at this point in time if you have it, I would suggest trying MMS first as MMS has eradicated a wide range of maladies. In my own personal experience traveling around the world and helping people with many different diseases, I have to say there have been positive results at least 95% of the time. I would say those are pretty good odds. At this time MMS is being used by thousands and thousands of people in more than 185 countries. Below are provisional steps one can take, a variation of my standard protocols and Health Recovery Plan, but something to try immediately in the case of coronavirus until you can get the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook. Here’s my suggestion: MMS must be activated drop for drop with the activator. Mix the drops in a clean dry glass, count 30 seconds so the drops can activate—they should turn amber color. After the 30 second count add 1/2 cup (4 ounces/120ml) of water, then immediately drink it down. (Do not leave this to sit for more than a few seconds, it must be taken immediately or it will begin to lose potency.) First, take six activated drops of MMS in 1/2 cup of water. Wait one hour, and then take six more activated drops in 1/2 cup of water. That may do it. You will know within two hours if it killed the disease by how you feel. What to do next depends upon how those first two doses made you feel. Follow these next directions carefully: If you feel better after taking the two 6-drop doses of MMS, reduce your intake to 3 activated drops in 1/2 cup of water every hour for eight hours a day, until completely well. You may want to continue this for up to 21 days to be sure you are free of disease and as an overall detoxification of the body. Always take the MMS within seconds of mixing up the dose. Any time you should feel worse when taking MMS, proceed with Any time after taking MMS activated drops you feel worse, cut your intake by one half but do not stop hourly doses. If you still feel worse cut your intake by one half again, but continue with hourly doses. Feeling worse after taking the MMS drops such as showing signs of nausea, diarrhea or headache is actually a sign that you are ridding your body of toxins. It is called a Herxheimer reaction. It indicates you are killing the disease, but you are killing it too fast—the point is go slow enough so as not to make yourself unnecessarily uncomfortable. These suggestions are only to get you started should you come down with a life threatening virus. You need the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook for complete instructions. There are more details and important things to know for getting well, such as do not take things that neutralize MMS such as coffee, tea, orange juice, milk, alcohol, things very high in antioxidants and so on, at the same time you take MMS doses. I wrote the Guidebook with all the details in mind, I simply cannot repeat it all here—so get the book. In the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, I have outlined a Health Recovery Plan which gives full instructions and protocols on how to handle other illness and disease. If you do not have coronavirus, but you think you have been exposed, you might want to take two 6-drop doses of MMS, an hour apart. I would then suggest doing the Starting Procedure, followed by Protocol 1000, as a preventative measure and as an overall detoxification of your body. And last, but not least, I recommend a daily maintenance dose of MMS for all. Full details of these protocols are found in the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, available here: jhbooks.org ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur … ) As mentioned above, educate yourself now—familiarize yourself with MMS today, don’t wait until you are in the middle of a crisis.

Revealing S. Korean studies show antibodies could thwart COVID-19 reinfection, spread. 	"Results from two new South Korean studies shed light on whether antibodies will be a reliable form of protection against COVID-19 for those who have recovered from the disease. SLIDESHOW: Coronavirus outbreak sparks global health emergency
In one ongoing study, the Korean Center for Disease Control found that 100% of 25 randomly selected patients who were hospitalized with symptoms and who fully recovered, developed defensive antibodies against COVID-19.
Researchers were initially concerned that antibodies might not kill the virus, because roughly half of patients had both antibodies and a current COVID-19 infection.
PHOTO: In this March 27, 2020, file photo, a machine dispensing COVID-19 novel coronavirus antigen and antibody diagnostic membrane, on a production line making virus testing kits at the SD Biosensor bio-diagnostic company near Cheongju, South Korea. (Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images, FILE) More Further investigation, however, suggested that the virus scientists detected might have been dead or so weak that it couldn't infect others.
In a second study of more than 10,700 COVID-19 patients, researchers examined 207 individuals who were re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering from their infections.
In 39 of those 207 re-diagnosed individuals, researchers did not find any virus replication in patient samples they analyzed.
In other words, the new research suggests that if a patient is re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering, it's unlikely he or she will be able to infect others.
Still, the KCDC cautioned, it's unclear how long those antibodies last. Until we have that key piece of data, the jury is still out on whether mass immunity is possible.

Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS - REPORT. 	"With the mounting concern about the growing Coronavirus we are republishing this article we published 7 days ago, taken from the excellent anti-imigration site Vdare.com , which if true, is hugely important to understanding the potential global growth of the Coronavirus. Unfortunately Vdare does not have a comments section, so it is hard to gauge how much engagement that article has gotten.
We have been following the people we think are the smartest Coronavirus analysts, like Chris Martenson at Peak Prosperity , and have not seen anyone address this issue, which is odd, to say the least, considering the implications. We cannot attest to the veracity of the science, but we assume that someone like Martenson could sort it out. If anyone as a connection to him, please bring it to his attention. It is very important. As the days pass, the thesis of this article seems to be being proved out - Chinese are succumbing to it in the hundreds of thousands, but there are hardly any white victims, and what few there are do not seem to be getting very sick.
Martenson has been putting out daily Coronavirus update videos on his YouTube channel , starting 3 weeks ago, which have been racking up millions of views, a testimony to the quality of his analysis. He has been saying from the beginning that there is a very significant likelihood that this is much more serious than SARS, or anything else we have seen come along, and that mainstream analysis is dramtatically underestimating this risk. He is a good person to follow to understand what is happening.
Here is one of his recent videos below, to give an idea of his approach:
Here is last week's article from Vdare's Lance Welton.
At the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published. All of these deaths have been in China. The disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020].
The Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians—specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as “ Oriental .”
Thus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC,com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be “Chinese nationals.” Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read “ First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , ” [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.
In fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a “Chinese tourist” [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].
If it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].
The authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens. Races—or, as they call them, “ethnic groups”—are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.
Many infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.
Thus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to “ natives ” in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries’ populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.
The Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.
According to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died, in France (where there were an, atypically high, 7 cases).
By contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17%. In Taiwan, it was 10%. In Canada, it was 17%, but it seems pretty obvious that they were all “ Chinese Canadians ,” what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to “help” them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization's role in public health —a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].
In Singapore, 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.
But essentially it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn’t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.
This effect was so pronounced that, Wkipedia reports , “Many Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.” (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons—a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists’ notorious desire to appease China).
The difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It ‘s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].
So if I wanted to tempt fate, then I’d write the following:
The Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM’s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic.
By not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans…so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than “race differences don’t exist, because race is a social construct.”
But race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that.

Patent Zero
THIS is the patent for the Canine Respiratory Coronavirus. It was patented in 1984, and the patent’s validity expired on January 24th, 2020. What happens when patent expires is that anyone can produce the virus without paying royalties to the original inventor. Here come the billions of dollars from the sale of vaccines after the populace has been spooked and enough people died.
The canine respiratory coronavirus was able to spread from dogs to bovine and to pigs. It was also able to cross over to humans. Much as all viruses, the coronavirus can mutate naturally or by human manipulation.

Do not profit from corona-virus outbreak: Taobao. 	"Chinese online giant Taobao has warned sellers using its platform not to profit from the deadly corona-virus outbreak by raising prices.
Fears over the spread of the virus in China have triggered a surge in sales of protective gear in Asia. Pharmacies have seen a rush for surgical masks, while rubber glove makers are braced for a jump in demand.
At least 17 people are reported dead, with more than 500 confirmed cases across China, and as far afield as the US.
Subsidy offer
Over the two days of January 20 and 21, more than 80 million masks were sold on Taobao, which is owned by Alibaba and is one of the largest online retailers in the world.
However, media reports suggested these included profiteers looking to quickly resell the masks at a higher price.
This prompted the online message from Taobao warning sellers they were ‘‘not allowed to increase prices’’.
In November, a pack of 20 3M masks sold for 178 yuan (£20), but on Tuesday sellers were charging up to 1 100 Yuan for the same item, according to a report in Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper.
Taobao said it would also offer ‘‘special subsidies’’ to make sure masks were ‘‘cost-effective’’ for consumers. On top of this, it will also continue delivery services during the Chinese New Year celebrations
Joleen Siew at Glovida, an e-commerce site based in Singapore selling health products, said it had seen a “significant spike in demand for masks compared to normal”.
“We’ve also seen more demand for immunity products like vitamins and supplements as parents want to protect their kids. Singapore likes to be pre-emptive about these things.’’
Denis Low, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association which represents 56 members told the BBC: “I have spoken to the members and we are all geared up if demand shoots through the roof as expected.
We will ramp up capacity and make some tweaks to productivity.’’
Malaysia produces around two-thirds of the world’s rubber gloves, predicted to be more than 150 billion pairs this year.
During the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 and 2010, Malaysian rubber glove makers saw a surge in orders of about 10-15 percent.
Mr Low, who works for glove maker Supermax, said the increase could be higher this time if the corona-virus continues to spread.
‘‘We are very worried about this virus and will do all we can to make sure we meet the demand. But we will not profiteer from this calamity by putting up prices,’’ he added.
Demand for face masks has soared
Major airlines have said they will supply protective gear to cabin crew and passengers who request them.
Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific was the first airline to announce it will allow cabin crew to wear surgical masks while operating mainland China flights due to infection concerns.
Singapore Airlines also said it is making surgical masks available to crew, and other carriers operating in the region are expected to follow suit.
A Cathay Pacific spokeswoman said: ‘‘We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to co-ordinate with the health authorities in Hong Kong and in all the ports to which we operate flights’’
As organisations take precautions to safeguard staff by buying masks and gloves, Chinese technology giant Tencent is taking even more drastic steps.
Founder Pony Ma Huateng will not hand out traditional red packets to employees to celebrate the Lunar New Year for fear of spreading the virus.
This is the first time in almost two decades Shenzhen-based Tencent has cancelled this traditional handout to staff. — BBC."
Patient tested positive' for 2019 nCOv in Makati Medical Center. 	 Claim: A message saying a “patient tested positive” for the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) at the Makati Medical Center circulated on messaging apps and social media platforms on Monday, January 27. The message read: “Hi team, please prevent going to Makati Med. My father-in-law informed us just now that one patient tested positive from Corona Virus (sic). Though naka quarantine na (the patient’s already quarantined)...but still. Also please wear surgical mask at all times most especially whenever we are in Enterprise or Makati area because... ang dami talagang galing china (there really are a lot of people coming from China).” The message continued: “Government banned direct flights from Wuhan but these people enter through different routes just so they would get out of Wuhan. Mala Train To Busan talaga ang dating (The situation is like Train to Busan) . Pati laging mag (Also always use) alcohol after using the elevator. Thanks thanks.” The message came from a certain “Janelle (Zenith),” as indicated at the bottom of the message. Three readers forwarded the message to Rappler for verification. Rappler also spotted at least two Facebook posts that said the same claim. Rating: FALSE The facts: There is still no confirmed case of the 2019 nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH). However, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing that there are a total of 27 persons under investigation as of 1:30 pm, January 28. Three of them have already been discharged as they tested positive not for 2019-nCoV but for other diseases. The Makati Medical Center reiterated the DOH warning against posting unconfirmed information about the novel coronavirus in a post on its official Facebook account. It was shared at 1:36 pm on January 27, or when the message about an alleged confirmed case started to spread. On January 24, the DOH announced that the 5-year-old boy with a suspected case of the new coronavirus in Cebu City tested negative . Rappler has so far debunked 3 claims since the novel coronavirus outbreak. On January 15, a false claim about a “SARS case” reported in a clinic at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong City came out. More than a week later, another false claim circulated, that there are “confirmed cases” of coronavirus at the PBCom Tower in Makati. – Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com Keep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.

FDA warns against use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of hospitals, clinical trials. 	"The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about the antimalarial drugs after it became aware of reported heart risks. Both have been embraced by Trump and others as a potential COVID-19 treatment.
The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Friday against using malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 outside of a hospital setting or formal clinical trial.
The drugs have been widely touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the new coronavirus. However, the agency said it became aware of reports of “serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin.”
RELATED: Calls mount for probe of firing of scientist who says he was let go after opposing Trump over drug
""We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions. Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,"" the FDA said on its website .
Both drugs are in clinical trials examining their effectiveness in treating and preventing COVID-19, but the FDA said neither are proven treatments.
Patients taking the drugs for approved reasons, such as malaria or autoimmune conditions like lupus, should continue taking their medicine as prescribed, the FDA added. Tablets of hydroxychloroquine are displayed in a file image taken on April 22, 2020. (Photo Illustration by Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Advertisement
The agency said the drugs can still be used in hospital settings or clinical trials, but it was not immediately clear whether some planned trials in the future would be stopped after the warning.
Remdesivir, an experimental COVID-19 treatment previously used to treat Ebola patients, has also garnered massive attention as the world scrambles to contain the pandemic with a proven medicine or preventative vaccine.
But in its first randomized clinical trial in China, the drug failed to have any effect, according to reports .
More than 100 different programs have been launched to develop and test treatments for COVID-19, as well as dozens of experimental vaccines against the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization ."
Routine Immunisation should not suffer due to COVID-19: WHO. 	"Shutting of immunisation services during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak could trigger a resurgence of diseases that are preventable due to vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.
In a statement released on April 23, 2020, the top health body said, ""When immunisation services are disrupted, even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, such as measles and polio, increase.""
Incidentally, most states in India too have halted immunisation activities. In some states, they are continuing at health centres, but the community health workers are no longer visiting homes to immunise a child. The Union government has twice said that it has written to states to resume these activities.
A group of public health activists wrote a letter to Rajasthan&apos;s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 23. Though immunisation services were being provided at health centres, parents were not able to go there either because of lockdown or the fear of catching COVID-19 disease, they wrote.
""There are districts where not even a single COVID-19 case has been reported or which are out of the hotspot criteria now,"" Chhaya Pachauli, a public health activist from Rajasthan, said.
""These services can easily be provided at the village level in these districts by following social distancing measures and by equipping frontline health workers with the essential protective equipment,"" she added.
The WHO too advised countries on similar lines.
""Last year&apos;s deadly measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which took more than 6,000 lives in a country already facing its largest Ebola outbreak, highlights the importance of maintaining essential health services, such as immunisation in times of emergency,"" the organisation said.
""Further disease outbreaks will also overwhelm health systems already battling the impacts of COVID-19,"" it added.
WHO&apos;s Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that while all efforts are on to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, if routine immunisation services are stopped, other diseases will come roaring back.
New WHO guidelines on immunisation and COVID-19 recommend that governments temporarily stop immunisation campaigns if there has been no any outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease.
""However, countries should prioritise the continuation of routine immunisation of children in essential service delivery, as well as adult vaccinations such as influenza for groups most at risk. If immunisation services must be suspended, urgent catch-up vaccinations should be rescheduled as soon as possible, prioritising those most at risk,"" it said.
The WHO has asked its member-states to act urgently to protect immunisation services even as the response to COVID-19 continues, in order to further minimise disease outbreaks and loss of life.
This includes facilitating urgent catch-up programmes in places where services have been disrupted, ensuring strong supply chains, disease surveillance and trained health workers.
In 2018, about 20 million children worldwide - more than 1 in 10 - missed out on life-saving vaccines such as those of measles, diphtheria and tetanus.
""Measles continues to remain an ever-present threat, especially if vaccination rates drop. Current projections indicate that as many as 800,000 people may have been infected with the disease in 2019,"" the WHO statement said.
""In 2020, there are increasing concerns about another resurgence, especially if vaccination rates fall due to delay or suspension of scheduled immunisation activities as a result of COVID-19,"" it added.

Enforce Mandatory Vaccinations and Coerce China to Comply with American Demands State of the Nation Everything Points to Biowarfare Being Used Against China
by the Western Powers Which Seek to Contain Her
Growing Power and Influence in the World Given the multiple and serious woes that China has suffered from during 2019, it comes as no surprise that the Western powers would now resort to bioweaponry. WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS : “Bioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system” If there’s one last hit to the economy that China doesn’t need right now, it’s a global pandemic that ‘supposedly’ originated in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province (see map below with the red marker identifying Wuhan). See how Wuhan is located right in the center of China’s highly productive southeast region—the economic powerhouse of the nation. This strategic location was selected for the biological attack because of the easily engineered vectors of disease dissemination as depicted by the map above. Paralyzing China’s economic and financial sectors is, after all, a primary goal of this essentially Anglo-American black operation. See: Why the coronavirus is a real threat to China’s economy In light of the US-staged Hong Kong protests, U.S. tariff regime against China, threat of economic sanctions against nations working with Huawei, CIA-inflamed Xinjiang conflict involving the Muslim Uyghurs, provocative sailing of US Navy warships through the Taiwan Strait, transparent political prosecution of Huawei’s CFO, ravaging of China’s pig farms by a bioengineered virus, etc., the Chinese government has been under withering attack since 2018. When so many debilitating assaults are suspiciously happening at once, what can China do except deal with them in a manner so as to expose the true culprits. However, China is not likely to do that in the case of this intensifying bio-war being waged by the West. SARS conspiracy theory The original SARS pandemic that took place in China after the turn of the millennium was also well-known in bio-medical circles as a naked act of biowarfare. Like this year’s coronavirus bio-attack in Wuhan, the bioengineered SARS outbreak also involved a highly coordinated campaign of propaganda and disinformation. See: Is the new ‘deadly China virus’ a covert operation? However, the administration of Xi Jinping is much too concerned about the panic that would inevitably result if the populace was informed of a full-blown bioweapon attack. The precipitating chaos would simply overwhelm the government in Beijing which is already on serious overload because of the endless interference by the Anglo-American Axis. The SARS outbreak that occurred from 2002 to 2003 has already shown that China is not willing to release the hard scientific evidence that proves the premeditated release of a bioengineered coronavirus. The following excerpt from Wikipedia explains some of the background of SARS—the Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that took place primarily in mainland China and Hong Kong, but also in Canada and other countries. Excerpt from SARS conspiracy theory Wuhan Coronavirus of 2020 The rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus, also known as Novel coronavirus, that was first reported in 2019 has all the hallmarks of yet another bioengineered virus in a U.S. Military laboratory. What follows is a short description form Wikipedia of this Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Time will tell whether this deadly coronavirus was released into the Chinese population with the intent to kill and sicken, scare and intimidate. The intimidation phase of such an ongoing black operation is certainly aimed at the government in Beijing which refuses to be coerced and threatened by the Trump administration. Because the highly disruptive, Western-backed Hong Kong protests have yet to yield the result desired by the U.S. State Department, it was only a matter of time before the C.I.A. implemented Plan B…or is this Plan C or D? KEY POINT: The replication process (see diagram above) of this particular coronavirus, and how quickly it mutates and/or adapts to various pharmaceutical treatment regimens, will reveal exactly how this pathogenic microorganism was bioengineered. Why China? The $64,000 question here is: Why is China always the epicenter for so many strains and variations of coronaviruses, influenzas, pneumonia viruses and other highly contagious infection agents that strike the major commercial centers on southeastern mainland. What’s particularly suspicious about all of these outbreaks in China is that they are each described by the Mainstream Media (MSM) as quite dangerous to human health. The mortality rate in the beginning of these eventual pandemics is especially high, as if by purposeful design of the bioengineers. In this way, the whole world is eventually drawn into a pandemic melodrama that’s certainly designed to fear-monger. Hence, more of these endless distractions serve the specific purpose of taking the attention away from real problems caused by governments everywhere. But it’s the numerous criminal conspiracies at work and shocking scandals that the elites seek to cover up by any means possible. You know it’s a distraction when Drudge hypes it like this. There are relatively few military bioweaponry labs in the world that have the capability to create such a fatal and infectious virus. Thus, when the truth is confirmed about the Wuhan flu, there will be only a few culprits who are behind these assaults against the Chinese people. In reality, should this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak become a full-blown epidemic in China it could represent an attempt to commit genocide. Likewise, if it becomes a bona fide pandemic, it could ultimately be labeled a crime against humanity, perhaps even genocide. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation It’s of paramount importance to understand that there really is a vast and highly organized New World Order conspiracy to foist a One World Government on the world community of nations. See: Is this Bill Gates’ long-awaited excuse to usher in global governance? There are several main pillars of this New World Order agenda, one of which is being stealthily put into place by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Likewise, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are slowly erecting one of the primary social media pillars as is Tony Dorsey at Twitter and Susan Wojcicki at YouTube. Bill and Hillary Clinton are using the Clinton Foundation to take advantage of poor countries around the world while surreptitiously laying the foundation for future exploitation on a mass scale just as George Soros & Sons are deceitfully creating new societies via geoengineered climate change, multiculturalism and cultural marxism. The crucial point is that all of these high-paid globalists are intimately connected to each other and covertly working to advance the same nation-destroying U.N. agendas. See: PEDOGATE : Epstein cofounded Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Gates hung out with Epstein AFTER conviction Fabricating global crises is at the very core of these various NWO sub-agendas. Two of the ‘scariest’ manufactured catastrophes are those that severely impact the biosphere (e.g. global warming) and undermine human health (e.g. deadly pandemics). In this way, false pretexts are being cunningly constructed to justify the establishment of an all-powerful One World Government . Toward that end, the NWO globalist cabal knows that they must first sufficiently manufacture consent so that the people demand a totalitarian form of global governance to manage these public health disasters and environmental catastrophes. Multi-billionaires such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros were all given their fortunes mostly through exorbitant corporate compensation plans, insider trading, currency manipulations, off-shore tax evasion schemes, and other forms of criminal unconscionable enrichment. Once they received those ill-gotten gains, they were completely own by the International Banking Cartel (IBC). The IBC then directs the expenditures of every single dollar given to these made tycoons, most of which are allocated toward carrying out the NWO implementation plan. The pet projects listed on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website are examples of that nefarious plan. Of course, the whole world now knows that their pet project is their worldwide Super-Vaccination Agenda , where every single person is vaccinated every year, on time, and micro-chipped accordingly. What better way to completely control the global populace? See: India To Prosecute Bill Gates For Using Tribal Children To Conduct Illegal Vaccine Test There is no better way to enforce a mandatory global vaccination schedule than to engineer a frightening pandemic with an exceedingly high mortality rate. Billions of people will then demand the newly formulated vaccine necessary to protect them from such a fatal infection and/or debilitating disease. Hence, before anyone receives such a vaccine, it’s important to know that the process REQUIRED to produce such an effective immunization is literally years from the making, if one is possible at all because of how intricately this coronavirus was bio-engineered to elude proper analysis and necessary experimentation. “It’s really quite easy for any of the numerous U.S. military bioweapon labs to bioengineer a deadly super-virus and then release it in a city as large as Wuhan, China. Acts of bioterrorism like this are carried out all the time. As a matter of historical fact, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 actually originated at Fort Riley, Kansas where soldiers reported to the Army’s largest training facility during World War I. The soldiers who were [DELIBERATELY] infected with the H1N1 influenza virus then served as countless vectors of dissemination for the pandemic that ultimately killed as many as 100 million people worldwide. That single US-executed biowarfare operation against humanity was arguably the deadliest depopulation event in human history.” (See: Spanish Flu of 1918 Was Really a Bioterror Attack on Humanity ) — Intelligence Analyst & Former U.S. Army Officer Conclusion There’s no better way to compel a populace to comply with draconian vaccination regimens than to scare them with the prospect of a deadly pandemic. Governments around the world are constantly under pressure from the New World Order globalist cabal to implement the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Toward that end, the world community of nations has been repeatedly victimized by manufactured measles outbreaks and ever-worsening flu seasons, so they tell us. See: Annual Flu Shot Programs and Staged Measles Outbreaks Are the Central Pillars of the Super-Vaccination Agenda However, there really is much more to this story than meets the eye. Not only was the Wuhan coronavirus surreptitiously disseminated to serve as a major distraction from a rapidly collapsing Global Economic & Financial System , this state-sponsored black operation also represents the worst of predatory capitalism conducted as a means of generating revenue. Much more significantly, this staged pandemic will be cunningly used to exert oppressive international controls on travel as well as impose draconian medical measures which greatly advance the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Lastly, the timing of the deadly virus that ravaged China’s pig farms last year quite predictably triggered a call for the development of a preventative vaccine. What the following news report neglected to state was that the mass slaughter of pigs, in a society that demands LOTS of pork, was cynically planned to manufacture the urgent need for yet another vaccine. See: China’s Pig Farms Decimated by Virus—Was it bioengineered and spread on purpose? The bottom line here is that the Wuhan coronavirus is likely another race-targeting bioweapon strategically unleashed throughout China by U.S. military labs Special Note: People, everything points to this bio-terror attack being the BIG ONE (also known as the global depopulation event we’ve all been waiting for). This coronavirus is moving around the globe so fast, and being hyped by the Mainstream Media with such a vengeance, it’s as though this will be their primary tool for total global lockdown. If the infection rate continues to proliferate into a full-blown pandemic, like The Powers That Be did with the Spanish flu, then this really is the depopulation event many of us have warned about. This highly misguided and naked act of bio-terrorism could even evolve into an ELE, God forbid. There’s no question that 2020 promises to be a year of pervasive and profound transformation. The current state of affairs throughout the world community of nations cannot continue; it’s far too unstable and explosive. Hence, it’s quite likely that there will be a series of global catalysts that will prompt the necessary changes. While some of these apocalyptic calamities may seem terrifying at first, ultimately they will serve to contribute to the ongoing planetary catharsis. Whereas many folks will see all of these End-time crises as being intentionally manufactured by the power elite to save their own skins, REMEMBER, even the Dark Side can only act as the Highest Power permits. Also, that, ultimately, “all things work together toward good” . State of the Nation
January 20, 2020 Recommended Reading SUPER-VACCINATION AGENDA Being Foisted On The USA 24/7 Update 1 After seeing their whole country burned down by Operation Torch Australia , how could the Australian government possibly refuse globalist orders to develop a coronavirus vaccine. (See: Always obeying their NWO globalist masters, Australia swiftly develops coronavirus vaccine! ) As it was previously stated, the typical Hegelian Dialectic Problem~Reaction~Solution strategy will now be used to foist a toxic vaccination regimen on the entire planetary civilization. Update 2 The NWO globalist cabal knows that fastidiously bioengineered viruses, especially those which are hardwired to rapidly morph and mutate so as to elude an effective remedy, are the most effective depopulation weapons in their arsenal. See: The bioengineered Spanish flu that killed upwards of 100 MILLION people originated at Fort Riley, Kansas Update 3 Even popular Alt Media platforms are being used to float planted propaganda and false narratives — PREEMPTIVELY — in order to deflect any and all attention from this transparent bio-terror attack by the West. See this purposeful headline, which is usually issued by the CIA’s Mockingbird Media , as an example of such a diversionary tactic and strategic misdirection: The Real Umbrella Corp: Wuhan Ultra Biohazard Lab Was Studying “The World’s Most Dangerous Pathogens” . Update 4 Fear-mongering headlines about China such as this one will only intensify until President Xi Jinping bends to the will of the Trump administration regarding the “trade deal from hell” : China On Edge Of Chaos: “7 Cities, 23 Million People Under Quarantine” . Oh, and by the way, the headlines now read like this today: “Beijing Calls In Military As Virus Overwhelms Wuhan Hospitals”. Who, pray tell, will travel to China in 2020 in view of these swiftly deteriorating conditions?! Who will want to do business there? Exactly—NO ONE. Which is exactly what the real perps wanted to achieve. Update 5 Will the utter panic being fueled by social media in China be used as a pretext to shut down vast swaths of the Internet? Both Big Tech and Big Social Media have been frenetically looking for ways to terminate the Alt Media . Here’s what the ever-prevaricating New York Times featured today: Panic and Criticism Spread on Chinese Social Media Over Coronavirus . We’re not saying it didn’t happen; only that the Mainstream Media will do whatever is necessary to destroy the emerging Fifth Estate . See: Fifth Estate Looms Larger Than Ever as Alt Media Exposes NWO Agenda and Deep State Treason Update 6 There’s an extremely malevolent aspect to this bio-terror operation: WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS : “Bioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system” Update 7 Why didn’t the U.S. implement the same type of border screenings as Russia and India? (See: Deadly Chinese coronavirus arrives in US as Russia, India & others boost border screenings ) The southern border, especially in California, is so porous and vulnerable to illegal aliens with deadly contagious diseases crossing over that any enemy could send infected Trojan horses into the Southwest all day long. Update 8 The United States Government is already notorious for recklessly releasing dangerous infection agents and contagious viruses into the national environment, as well as in foreign countries. One of the worst of these bio-terror operations unleashed in the 50 states concerns the multi-decade epidemic known as Lyme disease . For the unaware, the following video exposé spells it out in graphic detail: The Officially Ignored Link Between Bioengineered Lyme Disease and the Plum Island Bioweapon Laboratory Update 9 As suspected, the NWO perps are taking this bioengineered pandemic global very, VERY quickly. The United States now has 3 confirmed cases and 63 suspected ones. See: 46 Million Chinese Are Now Under Quarantine, More Than All Of California; Virus Jumps To Europe Update 10 ‘SPREADS THROUGH EYES’ : Coronavirus vectors of transmission increasing Update 11 They know how to time these terror operations: A ‘High-Level Exercise’ Conducted 3 Months Ago Showed That A Coronavirus Pandemic Could Kill 65 Million People Update 12 More and more Alt Media sites are calling this a hoax. While there may be aspects and details that are proven to be fake, that does not mean the entire psyop / black op is a hoax. As the perps often do, they blend grim realities with obvious falsehoods in order to confuse investigative journalists who then promote their own fictitious narrative. This tendency must be resisted until we see how this factually evolves. See: It’s way too early for the Alt Media to call this developing pandemic a hoax . Update 13 And along comes a PhD Toxicologist who really knows what he’s talking about regarding this particular coronavirus. Despite a degree from Duke University’s Department of Pathology, this trained scientist has left the reservation of political correctness and breaks it all down in this informative video: Coronavirus Is Worse Than You’ve Been Told . Update 14 Every bioengineered pandemic, especially those that have gone unidentified and/or unacknowledged, have a specific purpose for the targeted populations and bloodlines. Whereas the Spanish flu was as a full-scale depopulation event, the Epstein-Barr virus released during the 1960s was a stealthy bio-terror attack with a highly hidden agenda. The rebellious Beatniks and Baby Boomers were the explicit target of the EBV stealth virus as their health has greatly suffered since those original bouts of Mononucleosis. Likewise, everything now points to the great likelihood that the present act of bio-terrorism in China was conducted to expose as many people as possible in order to degrade the overall health profiles and undermine the immune systems of the susceptible populations. This is why the Chinese bloodlines were specifically targeted; they have been set up to suffer a similar fate as those who still suffer from EBV Stage IV some 50 years after that bio-crime. This analysis certainly does not preclude the distinct possibility that the Wuhan bio-attack could end up morphing into a major depop event. Only time will tell. Update 15 An essential revisiting of the Spanish flu genocide reveals that it was the prescribed aspirin which turned that influenza into such a mass killer. Therefore, it’s imperative that every person who contracts Wuhan coronavirus understands their treatment plan and is not taking any medicine(s) that can worsen it. Certain drug interactions, in particular, can significantly increase the severity of certain types of flu and their various symptoms. See: BEWARE: Spanish Flu Mortality Rate Soared Because of Doctor-prescribed Medicines Especially Aspirin Update 16 ‘The Father of the Coronavirus Virus is the CDC’, Brought to China by the C.I.A. Update 17 What’s vital to correctly comprehend throughout this unfolding global drama is that there are multiple scenarios developing in different parts of the world as various covert schemes are being executed by the perpetrators. None of these scenarios are necessarily mutually exclusive. While some of them described in these updates may even appear to contradict each other, they can all be true and/or operative at the same time. For instance, it has been reported that Man Who Pushed SARS Dud Now Pushing New Chinese Virus . That factoid might lead many to believe that the current outbreak is a media-generated hoax, when in reality it could be much worse than what is represented by the MSM. In other words, this complex conspiracy was made quite complicated and confusing on purpose to confound both medical researchers and scientific investigators alike. Update 18 What makes Wuhan coronavirus so challenging to closely monitor and potentially decimating is this: Coronavirus Stealth Strain Bioengineered to Avoid Detection in Carriers Who Present No Symptoms The U.S. military labs have been hard at work over decades perfecting their newfangled bioweapons. What that means is that a previous pandemic — known or silent — is craftily utilized to lay the foundation for a future one that, when overlaid, triggers a whole new multi-infection syndrome which is both deadly and difficult to identify, much less treat successfully. There are also multiple chemtrail aerosol formulations that are used to activate different flu pathogens that line the respiratory tract. That’s why so many now complain of both Chemtrail Flu and Chemtrail Syndrome . See: CHEMTRAIL SYNDROME: A Global Pandemic Of Epic Proportions Update 19 Now we know: Why are these 80 scientists now dead? And, why are they all microbiologists?

As mentioned above, Corona Virus Simulator is a new game developed by the Evil Scientists and Reptilians. It is a simulation game. Therefore it will allow you to take the role of a coronavirus. You can simply destroy human existence by spreading the deadly virus within the game."
UTHSC students volunteer on the frontlines at COVID-19 testing sites. 	"Hundreds of UT Health Science Center medical and nursing students are volunteering countless hours on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I can’t imagine a more real-world living laboratory experience for students than this,” said testing site director Dr. David Schwartz.
The medical school partnered with the city and Shelby County Health Department to provide COVID-19 testing for the past month.
 So far, the students have administered more than 3000 tests.
There are 150 UT Health Science Center medical students leading the charge in this effort.
They’re already volunteered more than 3,000 hours at testing sites.
Staff said it’s a one of kind opportunity where students oversee just about everything on-site with supervision from faculty members.
Dr. Schwartz told FOX13, “In no other program have I seen medical students not only given the opportunity to do all of these activities but also learn how to run complex organizations. To deliver high-quality care in a real-world setting, but to be able to do it well – that’s remarkable.”
Now they’ve expanded COVID-19 testing to Frayser, helping those in underserved communities. Students say these are the same communities they work with at clinicals throughout the year.
“We know as medical students that we’re supported by the community throughout the year and throughout our time here during our schooling, so just to give back a little bit to those communities is just an incredible opportunity for us,” said third-year medical student Chloe Hundman.
And what these students are learning goes beyond science and the spread of the virus. It’s something that can’t be found in a medical book – compassion.
Coronavirus: Dangerous new symptom discovered in patients “We’re interfacing with patients,” said third-year medical Lydia Meakpeace. “You know people are scared when they come to get tested, they’re worried in figuring out the best support them and be there for them, and being successful going forward and staying at home and protecting themselves and protecting their families.”
And the life lesson of paying it forward.
Makepeace said, “Faculty who are volunteering their time to come and supervise us so we can keep doing what we’re doing and that example for us and for all medical students at the site is really important for us to carry into our future.”
UTHSC staff said they are working to add another testing site out east in the Bartlett area, and they want to start mobile testing, bringing the tests directly to neighborhoods.
Staff said they’ll keep this testing going for the next six to eight weeks, or as long as it’s needed.
Testing in Frayser is at the North Frayser Community Center located 2555 Saint Elmo Avenue and it's tentatively scheduled to be open Monday through Wednesday next week."
US COVID-19 death toll passes 50,000; Georgia eases lockdown despite experts' warnings. 	"Barber shops, nail salons, gyms and a few other businesses reopened in Georgia on Friday as the Republican governor eased a month-long shutdown despite warnings from health experts of a potential new surge of coronavirus infections.
As some customers ventured back to these venues, the confirmed number of coronavirus deaths in the United States passed 50,000, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures.
Even though limited in scope, the reopenings in Georgia and at least two other states marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging the United States – and the world -- as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically damaging lockdown orders.
With deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to remain closed in spite of Gov. Brian Kemp’s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.
Kemp’s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for President DonaldTrump, who said Wednesday he “disagreed strongly” with the fellow Republican’s plan.
Without a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are an obligation here, a simple recommendation there.
Kids still attend soccer practice in Sweden while they are not even allowed outside in Spain. In the U.S. state of Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys were being allowed to reopen Friday even as American hospitals still heave with virus emergencies. In other parts of the globe, the prospect of a haircut is still weeks away.
There is no simple, one-size-fits-all answer. As governments and scientists fumble around, still struggling with so many unknowns, individuals are being left to take potentially life-affecting decisions.
In France, for instance, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be eased May 11.
In Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside. Even then, they will still have to abide by a “1-1-1” rule: no more than one hour per day, within a few minutes walk of their house and with no more than one supervising adult.
“The first day is going to be stressful,” said Eva Novillo, who has been confined with her wife and 7-year-old Ema in Madrid for more than five weeks. “We are going to be hysterical for the kids not to touch anything or not to touch their faces.”
The slowing of Spain’s horrific outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections.
The imperative to reopen is largely driven by economics, with lockdowns bleeding companies and government coffers of cash. In a trend seen around the globe, roughly 26 million Americans have filed for jobless aid in five weeks, pushing unemployment to levels last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s and raising the stakes over how and when to ease shutdowns of factories and other businesses.
Shutdown hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes in Germany placed empty chairs in streets and squares Friday to highlight their economic suffering. The prospect of sipping wine on a Paris sidewalk also is still far off: French authorities announced that restaurants, bars and cafes won’t reopen before June.
For many of the world’s poor, without social safety nets, idling at home or home-schooling kids with online classes are luxuries beyond reach.
Even in the world’s wealthiest countries, reopening too much, too fast raises the possibility of new infection spikes that again overwhelm hospital ICUs.
Japan initially seemed to have controlled its outbreak by going after clusters of infections. But on Friday, Japanese medical experts issued a stark warning that the country’s emergency medicine resources are reaching breaking point amid dire equipment shortages.
The coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and nearly 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The true numbers are undoubtedly far higher, and new cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.
In Muslim communities, the pandemic is casting a shadow over the holy month of Ramadan — marked by daytime fasting, overnight festivities and communal prayer. Ramadan begins for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims with this week’s new moon. Many Muslim leaders have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayer to ward off infections.
Some U.S. governors have begun loosening up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking the second wave of infections.
A major meatpacking plant in northern Colorado that closed because of an outbreak that killed four workers was set to reopen Friday after two-week disinfection, even as some questioned how employees can maintain social distancing inside the facility.
On the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Great Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.
U.S. President Donald Trump will be holding a signing ceremony Friday for a bill providing a nearly $500 billion infusion of coronavirus spending, rushing new relief to employers and hospitals. Leicester reported from Le Pecq, France. Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed."
"So.. patent on this ""new"" Corona virus expired... - Isaiah Rastetter. "	". . So.. patent on this ""new"" Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine. Ask yourselves this: What is in the vaccine that they want people to get so bad?

Logically, it's safe, in my opinion, to say that they would do the same with cancer. To get people to pay for the treatments. Take away hope so that they continue to buy into it. Cancer cells have already been found in vaccines. Educate yourselves. I've been firmly for vaccinating, my whole life. I now stand on the fence. Do your research.

India sees highest single-day rise with 1,752 new COVID-19 cases. 	" With 1,752 new positive cases in the last 24 hours, India recorded the highest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases on Friday, taking the country&apos;s tally to 23,452, while the death toll stood at 723.
However, the Health Ministry officials maintained that if the lockdown had not been announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when it was, there would have been one lakh COVID-19 cases in the country by now.
The good news is that with 489 recoveries have happened in a day; the rate of which has improved from 20 per cent to 20.5 per cent on Friday as a total of 4,814 patients have been discharged from the hospitals.
The Health ministry stated that no new cases were reported in 15 districts in the last 28 days. The new Corona-free districts are Durg, Rajnandgaon from Chhattisgarh and Shivpuri from Madhya Pradesh.
According to the ministry officials, the virus outbreak is under control in the country and with the help of a robust surveillance network, a total of 9.45 lakh people are under the surveillance.
While addressing a press briefing, chairman of Empowered Group-1 and Niti Aayog member V K Paul said: ""The lockdown has been effective in slowing the rate at which COVID-19 cases is doubling in India, and it now stands at 10 days.""
Paul also made it clear that the data or analysis of cases provided by the government is true and the chances of reconsolidation are negligible.
""If we go back to March 21, the cases were doubling in around three days. An important turn came on March 23 after the &apos;Janata Curfew&apos;. The direction changed and the doubling rate increased to five. By then, we had already put in place travel restrictions and had created an environment of social distancing,"" Paul said.
""There were some disturbances in between and we went back a little. But from April 6, the doubling time started improving,"" he said, adding that the nationwide lockdown has ""proved to be very timely and beneficial"".
""The curve has begun to flatten. Had we not taken the decision of clamping the nationwide lockdown, we would have had around 1 lakh COVID-19 cases by now, as per a reasonable estimate. Now, the outbreak is under control,"" Paul said, adding that these projections are based on the growth pattern at a particular time.
Director of National Centre for Disease Control S K Singh said surveillance has been the country&apos;s primary weapon.
As on Friday, India conducted 5,41,789 tests. There are at least 272 testing labs in the government network and 87 private labs to conduct the COVID-19 tests.
Meanwhile, the Centre on Friday said the COVID-19 situation is especially serious in major or emerging hotspot areas including Ahmedabad, Surat, Hyderabad and Chennai.
Four new interministerial teams have been sent to monitor the COVID-19 situation in Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, officials said on Friday.
""The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat), Thane (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana), and Chennai (Tamil Nadu),"" the statement said.

"A soldier wearing a protective mask checks a woman's quarantine pass as the city undergoes a stricter lockdown to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread, in Pasay City, Philippines, April 22, 2020. [Photo/Agencies] MANILA - The Philippine government on Friday announced that a lockdown in Metro Manila and provinces on the main island of Luzon with high number of coronavirus infections will remain in place for another two weeks or until May 15.
The Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry Roque made the announcement in a recorded televised address that enhanced community quarantine will remain in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon region comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon, and Lucena City, and all other areas with high cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission.
The entire main Luzon island in the Philippines has been under ""enhanced community quarantine"" from March 16 in a drastic bid to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
On April 7 the Philippine government announced that it's going to extend the enhanced community quarantine to April 30 as the government continues to fight COVID-19.
The Philippines has so far recorded 6,981 COVID-19 cases with 462 deaths and 722 recoveries."
CORONA VIRUS. 	"In a conversation over breakfast, a priest was telling us about an incident that happened on the bus as he was coming home from the university. A Chinese-looking man came into the bus which was pretty crowded. At the next stop, an Italian lady went-off the bus, and she was loudly declaring that the Chinese guy should also get-off because he might spread the Corona virus.
The poor guy just stood in silence, even as all the people in the bus was staring at him. According to the priest, he was not sure if the guy noticed the people looking at him, if he understood Italian, or if he was even Chinese. This is not the first time this has happened. Another Filipina related a similar story of how people consciously avoided her in the bus, just because she looks Chinese.
The Corona virus has stoked a lot of fears and prejudice. Those who looks oriental, even if they are Japanese, Korean or Filipino, are unfairly subjected to stereotypical discrimination. How much worse if they suddenly cough or sneeze in public. These are yet isolated cases, because there is still a large majority who does not care about the Corona virus, but they serve as a warning.
Personally I have been warned, because here in Rome, there have been many occasions when I have been mistaken for a Korean or Chinese. I do have a great-great-grandfather who is pure Chinese, so it is not so improbable that I may found myself in a similar situation. I am not worried about this, but I do care, because I have read a few articles saying that the Corona virus has allowed a lot of anti-Chinese sentiments to surface in the Philippines.
I understand that many have Filipinos have grievances against China, especially given the issues surrounding the West Philippine Sea. Some may have business or personal issues, and it is easy to hate on all Chinese in general. This is racial discrimination… and if we are followers of Christ, we should check ourselves because we might be allowing our anger and hatred to govern our attitudes and decisions.
The Corona virus has caused suffering. We are not spared from this suffering, and we are tempted to be anxious, to panic and to strike out. Sadly, we only look to our own discomfort, and we don’t care that there are people who suffer more than us. Then we justify our irrational anger and hate by saying that those who suffer deserve it… that it is a punishment from God for all the injustice that they have done to us.
If there is a better time to remember that we are Christians, it is in situations like this. Let us remind ourselves that the greatest commandment is to love, even to those whom we consider our enemies. Let us express this love even in simple kindness and charity towards our neighbors, especially in our personal relationships. Let us not allow the Corona virus to bring out the worst in us."
White House credentialed journalist blames Wuhan corona virus on trans kids & sexual immorality. 	"Pastor and pundit Rick Wiles went on a rant where he said that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100 people, is God’s plan “to purge a lot of sin off this planet,” including transgender children and “sexual immorality.”
Wiles is the founder of the far-right conspiracy website TruNews , which hosts his video broadcasts. But despite the site’s extreme anti-Semitism, homophobia, and disregard for facts, the White House gave it press credentials this past week .

While closing his show, Wiles said of the outbreak: “Spirit bears witness that this is a genuine plague that is coming upon the earth, and God is about to purge a lot of sin off this planet.”
He said that plagues are one of the last steps in the Last Judgment, just before war, and that China deserved to be the center of this plague because of its “godless communist government.”
And the U.S. isn’t much better, according to Wiles.
“Look at the spiritual rebellion that is in this country, the hatred of God, the hatred of the Bible, the hatred of righteousness, the hatred of innocence,” he said.
Specifically, this means: “Vile, disgusting people in this country now, transgendering little children, perverting them. Look at the rapes, and the sexual immorality, and the filth on our TVs and our movies.”
“Folks, the Death Angel may be moving right now across the planet,” he said. “This is the time to get right with God.”
“If you are living right for God, if the blood of Jesus Christ is on you, you have no reason to fear this Death Angel. But those of you who are opposing the church of God, mocking God, attacking his servants, you’d better wise up because there is a Death Angel on the loose right now, and you’re going to get an attitude adjustment.”
TruNews was issued credentials from the White House to cover Donald Trump’s trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last week.
“We want to thank President Trump and the White House for extending the invitation to be here,” Wiles said. “We are honored to be here representing the kingdom of heaven and our king Jesus Christ.”
Also, during a 2018 press conference at the United Nations, Trump took a question from a TruNews journalist. The site has also interviewed Donald Trump Jr.
The White House has not commented on why TruNews has been treated like a real news organization.
In 2014, Wiles said that an Ebola outbreak “could solve America’s problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography, and abortion.”
Wiles is also the senior pastor at Flowing Streams Church in Vero Beach, Florida."
White House Asks Scientists To Investigate Whether 2019-nCoV Was Bio-Engineered. 	"A week ago, we published details that raised questions about the source of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, specifically questioning the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market as a fabricated farce.
The real reason behind the viral spread, we suggested, was that a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada ) , was released by Wuhan's Institute of Virology (presumably accidentally ) , China's only top, level-4 biohazard lab, which was studying "" the world's most dangerous pathogens .""
At the time we summarized the series of dots and asked ""real reporters"" to connect them: One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp . Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world. His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ( such as the STING pathway in bats ) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Of course, that is all ancient history and Zero Hedge was permanently banned from Twitter for raising such a conspiracy theory about a publicly-searchable person working a publicly-searchable place.
But, bygones being bygones, we moved on... until today when no lesser entity than The White House began asking questions about the origin of the deadly coronavirus.
As ABC News reports, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts ""rapidly"" look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and ""to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.""
Specifically, ABC News' Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about concerns that stem from misinformation online that the novel coronavirus could have been engineered or deliberately released .
""There's always that concern ,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said.
""And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there's even any possibility much less likelihood that that's going on . And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.""
The White House has good reason to question the official story as evolutionary biologist Dr. James Lyons-Weiler of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge , showed and explained how the coronavirus' genetic sequence - which has been publicly released by China - contains a unique ""middle fragment"" encoding a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spike protein that appears, according to his genomic analysis, to have been inserted into the 2019-nCoV virus using ""pShuttle"" technology. This technique can only be done in a lab, as it has never occurred naturally in nature.
“This isn't a 'conspiracy theory', it is a scientific, medical theory,” says Del Bigtree, the Emmy-winning producer and founder of non-profit Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).
“Its foundation is based on sound science, logic, and research, and the mainstream media needs to be asked whether it is going to pursue this link to SARS instead of trying to censor anyone who is trying to pursue truth via scientific fact .”
One additional, major reason we suspect this line of logical reasoning could be correct - as conspiratorial as it may seem - is that Chinese authorities have launched a full-scale crusade to disprove the fact that this deadly virus was man-made.
""Conspiracy theorists don't believe in science. I hope that the national professional department will investigate and give us an innocence,"" Shi Zhengli, a director at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China - responded to Caixin on February 4.
Faced with external doubts and accusations, on February 2nd, Shi Zhengli responded angrily in the WeChat circle of friends:
"" The new coronavirus in 2019 is a punishment for uncivilized living habits of human beings by nature . It doesn't matter. I advise those who believe and spread rumours of bad media, believe in the so-called academic analysis that Indian scholars do not rely on, and close your mouth. ""
Additionally, as The Washington Times reports, one ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is the that false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.
That could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhan’s civilian or defense research laboratories .
As a reminder, it was discovered that Shi Zhengli had participated in a study published in Natural Medicine on November 9, 2015, about a disease that can be caused by a SARS-like coronavirus (SHC014-CoV) found in Chinese horseshoe bats .
The researchers used the SARS reverse genetics system to generate and identify a chimeric virus. In simple terms, this chimeric virus consists of the surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of the SARS virus. The chimeric virus can infect human respiratory cells, demonstrating that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to key receptors on cells and infect cells. Chimeras can cause disease in mice, but they are not lethal. Studies have shown that viruses currently circulating in bat populations could potentially trigger the potential risk of SARS-CoV (SARS virus) outbreaks .
We are sure this is all just a coincidence - Wuhan epicenter... Only P4 facility in China... A lab investigating bats infected with genetically engineered Coronavirus... Coronavirus infected Bats... Chimeric bio-engineered viruses.... and that is probably why The White House is now asking authorities to investigate the source of the disease.
Of course, when Zero Hedge suggested the same thing, highlighting key personnel in the Wuhan lab that were publicly acknowledged as responsible for that research, we were immediately banned by Twitter. We look forward to reading Buzzfeed's article decrying The White House for daring to ask questions about the origin of this deadly pandemic.
* * *
Correction: After publishing this article, we were contacted by Dr. Lyons-Weiler who requested that we strike through the terms expert virologist. He also would like to emphasize that he stated a hypothesis, has not stated 100% certainty about the origin of this virus and that analyses are ongoing. "

Wuhan Corona in UK Prison Confirms Suspicions MI6 Responsible for Spread of Virus. 	"Just 9 days ago, Abreu Report revealed groundbreaking information that the coronavirus which was speculated to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, China was actually a biological weapon designed to preserve the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom.
Just two days ago, The Voice of America , the international propaganda arm of the US government, cautioned: ""A Scottish lawmaker who won a landmark legal case against the UK government's suspension of parliament has warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson he faces legal action if he blocks a new vote on Scottish independence.""
Sacrificial lamb at altar of Brexit. Sky Today, we learn that a prison in the United Kingdom is experiencing an outbreak of the coronavirus after a prisoner was brought over from Thailand two weeks ago.
According to Thai authorities , there are only 33 people infected in the nation of 69 million souls, meaning that the individual extradited from Thailand won the coronavirus lottery.
It is highly unlikely that Mr. Rumble, the prisoner extradited to the UK, could have come into contact with an infected person if indeed there are only 33 cases in Thailand.
The Thai government is clearly lying, and so are UK authorities. Mr. Rumble's extradition was planned, and the objective is to sow fear in the population of Scotland and Northern Ireland, to prevent the end of the Union and the re-ignition of The Troubles.
If the Scottish people are to vote to break off from Westminster, they would only do so in the hopes of rejoining the European Union, an extremely unlikely event if the people can be made to fear open borders.
The fact that the Wuhan coronavirus is now in a prison in the UK means that this virus can no longer be contained, it can only be mitigated.
When British bodies start dropping on the streets, that's when the people will forget Brexit and think of nothing but the danger that foreigners pose to their lives. "
Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism . 	"As the numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths rise, so do the number of reports of racism or xenophobia against Chinese people in Europe and the US. It's not the first time it's happened either.
The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) in China has ushered three P-shaped elephants into the room: three things we don't want to name. First, there's pandemic . Second, there's panic. And third, there's phobia. But the greatest of these, to misquote the Corinthians, is phobia.
As in xenophobia. And racism.

The Biblical reference is not for nothing. Consider how illness and healing is handled in the New Testament ... Those who had leprosy were burned in Hinnom ( Gehenna ) Valley, which an Associated Press news agency report once cited as a ""synonym for Hell.""
Leprosy may be 'biblical' but it's not in the past: This leprosy patient was being treated at Curupaiti colony hospital in Brazil
But when the sick were healed, they are brought back into the fold.
Anecdotal vs. evidence-based research
The number of anecdotal reports of racism or xenophobia against Chinese people , or people who non-Chinese perceive to be Chinese, has been on the rise since the virus went global.
As it's anecdotal evidence, we feel it's okay to look away, with a shrug of ""We're not racist!""
But that's the very problem with such irrational feelings. They are almost impossible to track if you discount anecdotal evidence. Especially as journalists, it pays to keep your eyes and ears open, rather than merely relying on carefully crafted briefs from researchers or politicians. At the same time, there is a dearth of reliable evidence. Some numbers may even mislead us.

More Chinese cities on lockdown as coronavirus cases soar For instance, I could tell you that there's a statistical, high probability that people from China, or those who have traveled through Asia, will have a greater risk of catching the virus than you in some quiet American suburb. And you would think, ""Hmm, makes sense."" But without painstakingly checking a variety of data points, all you would have is a spurious logic to substantiate what we in the industry term BS.
A U.N. report called "" Dimensions of Racism "" calls for more disaggregated evidence that includes specific information on race and ethnic groups, even though ""biologically, there is only one human race.""
Viral on social
For now, you read posts on social media, where an Asian Supermarket in the German city of Cologne is at pains to make customers realize that ""We are not the virus!"" You hear stories, such as one from a colleague who just got back from my native London, where they saw passengers on public transport ""pulling their shirts up over their noses [as is if this would save them] when sitting near East Asian-looking people.""
Or you take a hard look at yourself, as this writer did the other day. Consequently, I'm prepared to out myself here as a racist and/or xenophobe (more on which in a moment). I was doing the weekly shop and happened to see a sack of oranges on special discount. Then I noticed they were from China, and I laughed to myself, ""I'm not touching those! Anyway, they're probably reduced to clear because of the lurgy!""
At the next shop I saw two people who may or may not have been Chinese, but they looked close enough for my irrational mind, and I kept starring at them, thinking, ""Have they just flown in? Have they brought the coronavirus to my quiet neighborhood?""

That poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth.
Corkscrew of fear and loathing
The current case of coronavirus is a little complicated.
To start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of ""unknown unknowns,"" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia.
That U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people ""based on the perception "" that they are ""outsiders."" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine ""plane loads"" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions.
As with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired.
As far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers
But then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need?
We in the ""West"" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there — whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely.
And it's happened before
The trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that ""normal reactions"" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and … wait for it … xenophobia.
But is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of ""normalizing racism"" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis).
Only I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on.
After all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about "" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination ."" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about "" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,"" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs.
And those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus
Avoidance psychology
But these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew — they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves.
In 2004, a paper about the "" psychology behind the masks "" referred to ""two diseases looming"" — one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about ""panic-stricken people"" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia.

None of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true .

World leaders launch plan to speed COVID-19 drugs, vaccine; US stays away. 	"As part of the launch of a World Health Organization initiative, a number of countries pledged on Friday to accelerate the development of tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them globally , as reported The Economic Times.
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined the virtual conference to launch what the WHO had portrayed as a ""landmark collaboration"" to fight COVID-19.
""We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, adding that ""experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.""
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort in May would be to raise €7.5 billion ($8.1 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.
""Although the US was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,"" a WHO spokesman said.
Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to join the initiative, adding that ""I hope we'll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the US, because this is about saying 'the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle'."""

Government official of the health agency: the Corona virus “is not something that the American public should worry about”. 	"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said Sunday that the American public should not worry about the outbreak of coronavirus in China.
“It’s a very, very low risk to the United States,” Fauci said during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis.
“But it is something that we as public health officials must take very seriously … It is not something that the American public should worry or fear.” Because we have ways to prepare and evaluate the people who enter [from China]. And we have ways to respond, as we did with this case in Seattle, Washington, which had traveled to China and brought the infection. “
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Saturday that there are 1,320 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, only two are in the US. UU. And most focus on China.
Fauci continued explaining that, since it is a virus, there are limited remedies to fight it or develop immunity among the population. He said that NIAID is working on a vaccine, although it will take about three months until they can begin testing it in humans.
“We just have to make sure we are fully prepared [since] Infectious diseases will continue to arise in the human species. And we have to be essentially perpetually prepared. “
It is still unclear how long the virus will be active in China, where so far more than 30 million people in the Wuhan, China area have been in quarantine.
Saturday was reported that the United States government is preparing a charter flight this weekend to evacuate US citizens and diplomats from Wuhan.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced on Saturday that it will move a qualifying event from Wuhan, China, to Amman, Jordan, for concerns about the outbreak.

Coronavirus Treatment and Vaccine Could Be a Step Closer Thanks to Antibody Which Can Neutralise 2019-nCoV. 	"Disabled Teen Left at Home Dies After Father Quarantined for Coronavirus
But Freedman said: ""much more work would be required before this could be used in patients and it is unlikely to work on its own. More likely a 'cocktail' of different antibodies would be required.""
He explained: ""Most effective antiviral agents, such as for HIV, work by blocking replication of the virus or entry of the virus into cells, rather than by neutralising the virus with antibodies which have to be administered by injection, rather than orally.
""That said, work like this is important to gain further understanding of this new virus in order to develop effective treatment and vaccines.""
Referring to the part of an antigen molecule which an antibody attaches to, Bill Keevil , professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, U.K., told Newsweek : ""If true then they are fortunate to have found a common epitope between SARS and Wuhan [2019-nCoV] for the same antibody to bind to, especially since SARS is only 80 percent related genetically to Wuhan [2019-nCoV].""
But first the team of scientists must find a way to scale up production, work out doses needed, and confirm it is safe to use in patients before it can be rolled out. "" Not trivial,"" he said.

Two Girls Kicked Out of Rishon Lezion Kindergarten Due To Fears Of Corona Virus. 	"An uproar took place in a kindergarten in Rishon Lezion on Tuesday morning, after a father brought two of his daughters, who recently returned from a trip to China to the kindergarten without waiting the mandatory two weeks in home isolation.
According to the Ministry of health, any person returning from China, must wait for two weeks in home isolation before they can go about their daily lives in Israel. The reason for the 14-day wait is that is the length of time of the incubation period for the Corona Virus.
Frantic parents, who saw the children, pulled their own children out of the kindergarten and sent vocal complaints to the management and to the city. The issue caused such an uproar that the father of the two children was called by the city and asked to take his daughters out of Gan until further notice.
In an interview with Channel 12 news, the father of the girls said: “Two hours after I dropped the girls off I received a phone call from the teacher asking me to come back and pick up my girls because all the other parents were complaining and freaking out. Other parents called me upset, and finally, the city called me and asked me to keep my daughters home. We aren’t lepers.”
A source in city hall said: “After the worries expressed by the other parents, we have come to an understanding with the parents of the two girls and they will not be returning to the kindergarten until a full understanding has been reached.”"

STATEMENT OF SECRETARY ANDANAR ON THE UNDERTAKINGS OF VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF 2019-NCOV. 	"We again would like to assure the public that the government is implementing the necessary precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
With the first case of 2019-nCoV confirmed yesterday and the World Health Organization having declared the virus as a public health emergency of international concern, we have intensified our preventive and control measures. It is a concerted effort being taken by our different agencies, to ensure that an outbreak is avoided.
The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) has advised local government units to create their respective Coronavirus Task Force to contain the spread of the disease at the local level.
The said Task Force will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and gadgets; that local health workers are trained in the prevention, control, and containment of the coronavirus; and that those suspected of nCoV are referred and transported to Department of Health (DOH)- designated-coronavirus referral center or hospitals.
LGUs are also tasked to conduct information campaigns regarding the virus as well post public advisories and preventive measures the public can take.
The Department of Education (DepEd) likewise, continues to promote awareness regarding the virus in schools and immediate communities through information materials from DOH. DepEd has also expanded the work of its Taal Quick Response and Recovery Team to include the nCoV matter.
The Department of Transportation and its attached agencies have implemented safety protocols as early as January 23. It has been closely coordinating with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) to support in securing transport terminals and in monitoring arriving passengers.
To contain the spread of nCoV, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has reactivated its communicable disease preparedness procedures on all CAAP-operated airports, especially those with international flights.
Airport frontline personnel have been advised to follow precautionary measures, to exercise extreme vigilance in handling passenger arrivals, and to strictly monitor those who may be infected by the virus.
The Civil Aviation Board (CAB), meanwhile, resolved to immediately and indefinitely suspend all air services operations between Wuhan and any point in the Philippines.
To make certain the safety of public land transportation, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has mandated all public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and conductors to wear face masks at all times and have asked franchise holders to ensure compliance. Terminal operators were also directed to ensure proper sanitation and provide face masks and disinfectants or sanitizer for free, for passengers to use.
The Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) issued an advisory on January 23 which advises ship owners and operators to take the necessary measures to monitor the 2019-nCoV and to report suspected cases of nCoV. Ship owners and operators were also asked to install necessary medical equipment and to equip their personnel with full information about the virus.
The MARINA has put in place monitoring procedures such as body temperature tests for people entering its building, wearing of masks for its frontline personnel, and the provision of alcohol dispensers at its entrances and comfort rooms. Its premises are also being regularly sanitized.
In order to keep the public informed, the PCOO has also activated its Laging Handa communications team to provide information and updates from government agencies regarding the 2019-nCoV through all government media platforms.
These measures are all being undertaken by various government agencies to contain the spread of the virus. We enjoin the public to be vigilant and conscientious, and to work with the authorities and follow their prescribed procedures and precautionary measures. Preventing the spread of the virus is a shared effort, which requires the cooperation of everyone."
Forum stresses scientific sharing to beat COVID-19. 	"The world has seen an ""incredible 12 weeks of scientific progress"" that has unraveled many secrets about the novel coronavirus, but there is still much to be learned and rapid sharing of quality research and international collaboration are needed to understand and contain the pandemic.
Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said in an online panel on Wednesday that he appreciates the wealth of knowledge that Chinese scientists have generated and shared.
The panel featured nine prominent medical experts from China and the United States. It was hosted by NEJM Frontiers in Medicine, a digital media platform of NEJM Group, and the Jiahui Medical Research and Education Group to share the latest research, from treatment to containment strategies, against COVID-19.

Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, Part 1: Communist Coverup, or Pandemic Bioweapon of Mass Destruction?. 	Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, able to enter and infect human cells’ ACE2 receptor via its spike protein. The official story about Coronavirus 2019 nCoV is that it “appears to have originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 650 miles south of Beijing that has a population of more than 11 million people.” This tale has been officially reported as early as January 9th by CCP’s state-owned and operated news channel, Xinhuanet, New-type coronavirus causes pneumonia in Wuhan: expert , reported by local Chinese authorities to the US National Library of Medicine database, Outbreak of Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology in Wuhan China: the Mystery and the Miracle and to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases database, The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health — The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China . Claims of surprise by Chinese scientists and State officials are arguably inauthentic But let’s take a deeper look at the glaring discrepancies in the official story to the underlying and background reality of coronaviruses, especially in the SARS-scarred land of China. The Sun reports that the current consensus centers on the belief that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is linked to bat soup sold at the market. However, the article states that experts “had thought the new virus wasn’t capable of causing an epidemic as serious as [previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola] because its genes were different,” something that simply isn’t true. In 2006, renowned virologist Professor Zhengli Shi co-authored the study, Review of Bats and SARS , concluding that “a SARS epidemic may recur in the future and that SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) that originate from different reservoir host populations may lead to epidemics at different times or in different regions…. The recent discovery of a group of diverse SL-CoVs in bats support the possibility of these events….” Bowl of hot, delicious bat soup served at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. A concurrent article published in the South China Morning Post on January 22, 2020, entitled Coronavirus weaker than SARS but may share link to bats, Chinese scientists say reports the latest findings on the coronavirus by scientists at China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “The scientists’ findings, published on Tuesday, suggested that the danger posed by the pneumonia-like virus may have been underestimated by the research community.” However, Prof. Zhengli and her co-authors published a study early last year on March 2, 2019 entitled Bat Coronaviruses in China which explicitly warned, “During the past two decades, three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as the cause of large-scale disease outbreaks⁻Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS). SARS and MERS emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and caused a worldwide pandemic that claimed thousands of human lives, while SADS struck the swine industry in 2017. They have common characteristics, such as they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock, their agents originated from bats, and two of them originated in China. Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China . Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China” (emphasis added). The South China Morning Post article continues with the beguiling assertion, “Previously, most scientists believed the new virus could not cause an epidemic as serious as that of SARS because its genes were quite different. But the new study found that, like SARS, the virus targeted a protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).” Apparently, the virology scientific community not only failed to heed Prof. Zhengli’s explicit, recent dire warnings about the “high likelihood” that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks would originate from bats — they also ignored Zhengli’s incredibly pertinent report published ten years ago in July, 2010, Identification of key amino acid residues required for horseshoe bat angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 to function as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus . The study’s abstract can’t be clearer on the immunological risks associated with protein ACE2, with its obvious liability for usurpation by viral agents with a little modified genome sequencing: “Angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A previous study indicated that ACE2 from a horseshoe bat, the host of a highly related SARS-like coronavirus, could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate that a 3 aa change from SHE (aa 40–42) to FYQ was sufficient to convert the bat ACE2 into a fully functional receptor for SARS-CoV. We further demonstrate that an ACE2 molecule from a fruit bat, which contains the FYQ motif, was able to support SARS-CoV infection, indicating a potentially much wider host range for SARS-CoV-related viruses among different bat populations.” This old but remarkable study concludes that only a minor genome sequence change was required to convert a non-susceptible bat ACE2 protein into a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, something that could easily happen in nature. “Considering that there are more than 60 different horseshoe [bat] species around the world (Flanders et al., 2009; Rossiter et al., 2007), it is possible that one or some of them may serve as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and/or its progenitor virus(es).” Why is it that current State virologists are apparently ignorant of these essential discoveries of yesteryear? The South China Morning Post article cited above summarizes two primary known facts about the new coronavirus: first, that a “virus found in fruit bats is [the] common ancestor of the two strains [Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and SARS],” and that this “new strain has [an] unusually high ability to bind to a human protein.” And the new study on Coronavirus 2019-nCoV by the joint research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the People’s Liberation Army, and Institut Pasteur of Shanghai indeed found that, like SARS, the virus targeted the ACE2 protein. It’s just as Prof. Zhengli predicated a decade ago: “…the fact that an ACE2 protein from a megabat, the fruit bat Rousettus leschenaultia, can function as a receptor for SARS-CoV would suggest that the host range for SARS-CoV or SL-CoVs may be much wider than originally thought.” So what happened — did the virology and surrounding scientific community drop the ball on these well-established findings and warnings, or what? After all, at least as February, 2008, they knew three key facts about ACE2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which uses ACE2 as its receptor for cell entry. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein, known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. Whereas the SL-CoV spike protein was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor, and the SARS-CoV spike protein failed to center cells expressing the bat ACE2, the chimeric spike protein the study created did gain its ability to center cells via human ACE, and A minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function. We know they knew these facts way back in 2008 because Prof. Zhengli published the findings of these facts in her report, Difference in Receptor Usage between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and SARS-Like Coronavirus of Bat Origin . Therein the scientists concluded, “Knowing the capability of different CoVs to recombine both in the laboratory and in nature, the possibility that SL-CoVs may gain the ability to infect human cells by acquiring spike protein sequences competent for binding to ACE2 or other surface proteins of human cells can be readily envisaged.” Thus, it seems strange and perhaps even disingenuous that the new joint CCP government-joint Coronavirus 2019-nCoV task force is seemingly ignorant about coronavirus targeting the ACE2 protein, apparently pretending it’s only just now discovered this. After all, Zhengli’s 2008 report was quite clear about the role that this ACE2 protein would play in future pandemics: the study “strengthened our belief that ACE2 from certain bat species could be able to support SARS-CoV infection because of the predicted genetic diversity of bat ACE2 variants in different bat species.” What is the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, where is it, and why is it pertinent? Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, the only P4 lab in China, headquartered at Wuhan Institute of Virology. At any rate, the forgoing storyline is the official word on Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, manifesting itself somehow in a seafood market in Wuhan. But what else might be found in Wuhan? After all, Wuhan is the capital city of the Hubei Province, home to some 11 million Chinese citizens. Well, curiously underreported is the fact that China’s first high-level biosafety laboratory is located just 8.6 miles away. “Used to study class four pathogens (P4), which refer to the most virulent viruses that pose a high risk of aerosol-transmitted person-to-person infections,” Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is the darling, cutting-edge hi-tech baby of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is the only such lab in China where dangerous, highly communicable viruses such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and assorted coronaviruses can be “safely” toyed with. China’s National Biosafety Laboratory, located at Wuhan Institute of Virology, is only 8.6 miles away from the claimed epicenter of the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak. Do you believe in coincidences? What’s odd is that despite completing the decade-long construction and having the official inauguration of this P4 laboratory on January 31, 2015 — announced by the General Office of Hubei Provincial People’s Government, it wasn’t until 2 and 1/2 years later in January 2018, that the Chinese government announced that the lab was actually in operation. And ahead of the lab’s second opening in January 2018, biosafety experts and scientists from the United States expressly warned “that a SARS-like virus could escape,” much in the same way the SARS virus had escaped multiple times from a lab in Beijing. So what on earth could these scientists have been doing in their brand new, state-of-the-art biotech base for 2 and 1/2 years, if it wasn’t officially in operation? And what have they been doing since their second opening in 2018? Scientists at Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory research coronaviruses, Ebola, and other deadly pathogens. Well, storing, researching, and experimenting with numerous fulminant disease pathogens, of course. After all, the lab is “preservation center for virus seeds, a fulminant disease pathogen storage facility, a reference laboratory of WHO, a node for disease network, and finally…a core in China’s emerging disease research network.” Basically, in all of China, Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is the only place to store and experiment with the most lethal, most virulent, most rapidly-spreading disease pathogens known to humanity. The lab is in “the central region of Central China, with mountains at three directions, convenient transportation and relatively independent environment” [sic]. And convenient it is, as you can play with Ebola, SARS, Hantavirus, and assorted coronaviruses in the morning…and then hop in your car and have some bat soup for lunch at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on the other side of the Yangtze River. Maybe BYOB — bring your own bat? Once Wuhan Institute of Virology formally put their brand new Cellular Level Biosafety Level 4 Laboratory into operation, we can safely take their word that they followed up on their promise to “conduct research for natural focal viruses including Ebola virus and other emerging viruses, such as researches [sic] on rapid detection system, molecular epidemiology, infectious disease etiology, therapeutic antibody, vaccine and drug evaluation, and assessment on biological risk factors, thus building a biosafety platform in China for emerging and fulminant infectious diseases in terms of isolation and identification of pathogen, building of infection models, vaccine development, biological containment and research on mechanism of interaction between pathogen and the host.” And one thing we know they worked on is the Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses , pioneered by none other than the enormously qualified, highly-decorated, and widely-respected Professor Zhengli Shi, Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator. Who is Professor Zhengli Shi and what is her relevance to Wuhan Institute of Virology and the National Biosafety Laboratory? Professor Zhengli Shi, Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator of Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory. Do you believe in coincidences? Because it just so happens that Prof. Zhengli has been ardently researching and experimenting with coronaviruses for years at Wuhan Institute of Virology — even before ground was broken over a decade ago on the new P4 National Biosafety Laboratory. Interestingly, the scientist seems uniquely perfect for her role — like a “Neo” figure in a laboratory version of The Matrix . In fact, Prof. Zhengli has been Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator of Wuhan Insititute of Virology for the last 20 years, initially starting as a Research Assistant in 1990 before upgrading to Research Scientist in 1993, serving in that role until 1995. Aside from a 5-year leave from 1995 to 2000 to get her PhD at University of Montpellier in France, she’s been at the Institute for an amazing 30 years. Notably, starting in 2014, Prof. Zhengli began to win particularly large sums of grant funding for the express purpose of researching and experimenting with coronaviruses — often receiving numerous, overlapping grants for the same time period. What’s just as interesting is where a lot of this funding originated — the US government. On January 6, 2014, Prof. Zhengli received a US$665,000 grant from the National Institute of Health for a study named The Ecology of Bat Coronaviruses and the Risk of Future Coronavirus Emergence (NIAID R01 AI1 10964) and then four days later on January 10, 2014, an additional US$559,500 grant from the United States Agency of International Development for research studied entitled Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT 2_China (Project No. AID-OAA-A-14–00102). On top of these lucrative American grants she concurrently received similarly significant grants from the National Basic Research program of China, the Chinese Academy of Science, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and from the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences totaling over US$2,500,000 for researching interspecies transmission of zoonotic viruses, the identification, genetic evolution and pathogenesis of bat viruses, the genetic variation of pathogens in Africa, the evolution mechanism of the adaptation of bat SARS-related coronaviruses to host receptor molecules, the risk of interspecies infection, genetic evolution and transmission mechanism of important bat-borne viruses, and pathogen biology studies on novel swine coronaviruses. In just the past five years alone, Prof. Zhengli Shi has almost US$10 million in grants to study coronaviruses. We can quite safely conclude that when it comes to interspecies coronaviruses, Professor Zhengli Shi is a bona fide Jedi master. In fact, her Wikipedia page credits her and her colleague, Cui Jie, with the actual discovery that the SARS virus originated in bats. Her noted “Research Interests” on her C.V. include “Discovery of unknown viruses in wild animals especially bats, molecular epidemiology of emerging zoonotic viruses, and interspecies infection mechanism of zoonotic viruses.” Prof. Zhengli appears to be one of the world’s leading bat virologists — and most definitely the leading bat virologist in China. Indeed, her C.V. explicitly states, “Prof. Zhengli Shi ’s researches focus on the molecular epidemiology and interspecies infection discovery and characterization of novel viruses in bats and other wildlife. She has gain [sic] rich expertise on pathogen biology of coronaviruses and other emerging viruses of bat origin, virus discovery, virus evolution, and development of diagnostic technologies for emerging viruses. Prof Shi has identified ultimately the animal origin of SARS, by discovering genetically diverse bat SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr CoV), isolating bat SARSr CoVs highly homologous to SARS CoV that are able to the same receptor [sic] as SARS CoV, and revealing the potential recombination origin of SARS CoV. She has discovered a large number of novel viruses from Chinese bat populations, including viruses with potential public health significance.” Unsurprisingly, Prof. Zhengli has been featured as a key presenter at over two dozen international virology conferences, the latest being From SARS to SADS: predict of emerging infectious diseases , held at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2018. Her presentations at the next five most recent conferences all relate specifically to the genetic evolution and interspecies infection of bat coronaviruses. A complete list of Prof. Zhengli’s conference presentations may be found in Appendix B. Nearly all of Prof. Zhengli’s recent conference presentations relate to bat coronaviruses. Do you believe in coincidences? Prof. Zhengli has been or is currently a professional member of the Chinese Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2000–2016), the Chinese Society for Microbiology (2002-present), the American Society for Microbiology (2007-present), and the Scientific Committee of the DIVERSITAS ecoHEALTH Core Project (2014–2016). She has served on the Editorial Board of Virologica Sinica (2016–2016), on the Editorial Board of Journal of Medical Virology (2015–2017), and on the Editorial Board of Virology (2017–2019). She was Associate Editor of Virology Journal (2016–2018), and Editor-in-Chief of Virologica Sinica (2017–2019). Prof. Zhengli is also the recipient of numerous, prestigious awards and honors, including the Natural Science Award of Hubei Province, China (First Prize and Second Prize), Outstanding Scientist of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Outstanding Research Article on Natural Science (Grand Prize and Second Prize). OK, but how is Prof. Zhengli relevant to the current new outbreak of Coronavirus 2019-nCoV? Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China — where the National Biosafety Laboratory is located — causes a massive quarantine of 11 million citizens. Chinese scientists, researchers, and doctors examining the emergent 2019-nCoV Coronavirus report that the new viral menace appears to be “a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor.” But Prof. Zhengli appears to have worked with recombinant Coronavirus derivations involving viral spike proteins for over a decade at Wuhan Institute of Virology, all the way back to 2006 and up to as recently as December, 2019 — the very month that 2019-nCoV Coronavirus was first reported as having infected visitors at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market just down the road from her laboratory! The day before the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak, this report was published. Do you believe in coincidences? In fact, on the day before the new coronavirus would find its first victims just 8.6 miles away at the market on December 12, 2019, Prof. Zhengli and her team published the study entitled Molecular mechanism for antibody-dependent enhancement of coronavirus entry on December 11, 2019. The abstract reads, “Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.” And immediately after this study was published — literally the following day — the first victims became infected with what would soon be named Coronavirus 2019-nCoV began to get infected…just a few miles away from Prof. Zhengli’s laboratory. And as The Sun reports , victims of the new coronavirus are infected via a strong binding affinity to a human protein called ACE2,” in precisely the identical manner as Prof. Zhengli’s just-discovered “novel molecular mechanism” identified (or engineered) literally weeks if not days before. Do you believe in coincidences? Let’s say that’s just a coincidence Prof. Zhengli published a study or two specifically on bat coronaviruses. Have there been others? How much time you got? The above study, specifically relating to human host cell binding and entry of coronavirus infection, and published the day before the first viral infections were reported at a location adjacent Prof. Zhengli’s laboratory, is far from the only study in which she has directed on the subject. The scientist’s entire virology history is rife with hands-on experience with coronaviruses, with especial attention devoted to understanding their spike protein properties, as related to potentiality of human cell entry and infection. In June 2016’s study, Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus WIV1 Encodes an Extra Accessory Protein, ORFX, Involved in Modulation of the Host Immune Response she writes that what was important was that bats “harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), and some of them have the potential for interspecies transmission.” She further states that her team created a “reverse genetics system” that would be helpful for “study of the pathogenesis of this group of viruses and to develop therapeutics for future control of emerging SARS-like infections.” In a letter to the editor of SCIENCE CHINA Life Sciences published in November, 2017, entitled Cross-neutralization of SARS coronavirus-specific antibodies against bat SARS-like coronaviruses , Prof. Zhengli warns that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is considered to be an emerging zoonotic pathogen crossing species barriers to infect humans, and that the spike protein of the virus’ RNA genome plays a key role in human cellular entry. In that same month, the results of a study Prof. Zhengli conducted, Serological evidence of bat SARS-related coronavirus infection in humans, China indicated that some SARSr-CoVs may have high potential to infect human cells, without the necessity for an intermediate host. In 2016, one of the Directors at Wuhan Institute of Virology posted the annual Director’s Message , of which the following finding was the top announcement: “The live SARS-like coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 has been isolated for the first time from the bat droppings; and such virus has been confirmed to invade the host cells through the ACE2 of human beings, civets and Rhinolophus sinicus. The research result has so far provided the most convincing evidence to the view that Rhinolophus sinicus is the natural host of SARS-CoV (Nature, 2013).” Does this not sound precisely like Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, which invades the host cells through the ACE2 protein? At any rate, since Prof. Zhengli is Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator of both the Emerging Viruses Group and the National Biosafety Laboratory, this is squarely her turf; the current outbreak seems amazingly similar. In a study conducted in September of 2015, Two Mutations Were Critical for Bat-to-Human Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus , Prof. Zhengli and team successfully achieved viral entry (bat-to-human transmission)of bat coronavirus HKU4 via its spike protein by performing two small mutations. Doing so also helped explain how MERS coronavirus was able to infect humans as well. It was in 2015’s study, Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to the Direct Progenitor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus that Prof. Zhengli and team highlighted “the likelihood of future bat coronavirus emergence in humans” by isolating a new bat coronavirus closer to SARS-CoV in genomic sequence, particularly in its spike gene. “Cell entry and susceptibility studies indicated that this virus can…infect animal and human cell lines,” they concluded. And in 2010’s Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins of different bat species confer variable susceptibility to SARS-CoV entry Prof Zhengli and her team of scientists “extended [their] previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays.” Even earlier in 2010, Prof. Zhengli published, Bat and virus , a keystone study identifying bats “as a natural reservoir of emerging and reemerging infectious pathogens,” emphasizing that an astonishing amount (more than 70, at the time) and genetic diversity of viruses isolated from the bat have been identified in different populations throughout the world. She stresses that many viruses were found in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may have a particularly robust immune system or “antiviral activity against virus infections.” In 2009’s Immunogenicity difference between the SARS coronavirus and the bat SARS-like coronavirus spike (S) proteins , Prof. Zhengli and her team concluded “SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) in bats have a similar genomic organization to the human SARS-CoV.” And notably, that this work “provides useful information for future development of differential serologic diagnosis and vaccines for coronaviruses with different S [spike] protein sequences.” Prof. Zhengli’s research in 2009’s Differential stepwise evolution of SARS coronavirus functional proteins in different host species produced results that supported the hypothesis that “SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events.” Moving even further back in time to 2007, Prof. Zhengli worked on Determination and application of immunodominant regions of SARS coronavirus spike and nucleocapsid proteins recognized by sera from different animal species , producing assays that would be a “useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of SARS-CoV and to minimise the risk of animal-to-human transmission.” It appears that 2006 was the year Prof. Zhengli first researched recombinant spike proteins along with other distinctive genome sequences resulting from the interaction of bat, palm civet, and human isolates. “Full-length genome sequences of two SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats and genetic variation analysis.” Basically, she is tremendously versatile and adept in her research whenever she encounters these recombinant spikes proteins in viral interactions. Moreover, it’s not just coronaviruses from bats that she and her team have discovered and explored, but also diverse novel viruses/virus antibodies in bats, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, circoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses. In fact, Prof. Zhengli has coauthored over an astounding 130 publications on viral pathogen identification, diagnosis and epidemiology — nearly all of which commandeered at Wuhan Institute of Virology where the National Biosafety Laboratory is located and where she reigns as Head of the Department. In fact, on the World Society for Virology website, Prof. Zhengli’s profile confirms that one of her great contributions was to “uncover genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses in bats with her international collaborators and provide unequivocal evidence that bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.” Thus, her adeptness in the specialized field of bat virology — especially where transmission to humans is concerned — is inarguable. Such an expansive personal history of expertise into coronaviruses is not only impressive, but unique, and the bulk of her 30-year career at Wuhan Institute Virology seems to have been dedicated primarily to the examination and exploration of all facets of interspecies (though primarily bat) pathogenic infection of coronaviruses into human host cells. For reference, you can check Appendix A for the sum total of all her published (or otherwise unclassified or declassified) studies at the end of this essay. Prof. Zhengli’s absolute mastery of bat-to-human transmission of viruses via their spike protein binding with human cell receptors is virtually conclusive and unrivalled. Unanswered Questions About the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Outbreak in Wuhan In Prof. Zhengli’s March 2019 study, Bat Coronaviruses in China , she proves seemingly prophetic, writing that it was “highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China.” Just nine months later, 2019-nCoV rears its viral head, less than 10 miles from her labatory: how did Prof. Zhengli know? The Sun cited a Nature.com report voicing warnings given back in 2017 “that a deadly SARS-like virus could escape from lab [sic] in Wuhan set up to study some of the world’s deadliest diseases.” The worries surrounding Wuhan’s laboratory surfaced almost an entire year before the Chinese government announced its official commencement of operation in January, 2018. And likely with good cause, as the “SARS virus [had] escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey.” However, the article in The Sun exaggerates the distance from Wuhan’s National Biosafety Laboratory to Huanan Market, erroneously claiming that it’s 20 miles away, instead of 8.6 miles, and also states that Dr. Ebright reportedly said “at this point there’s no reason to harbor suspicious that the facility had anything to do with the outbreak.” Seriously? Does Dr. Ebright believe in coincidences? Another new article from The Sun published January 23, 2020, reports a “new study was carried out jointly by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the People’s Liberation Army and Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, revealing that the coronavirus has a strong binding affinity to a human protein called ACE2.” But Zhengli and her team mates have been aware of the susceptibility of ACE2 to SARS and coronavirus infection for at least the last ten years, publishing their studies with the US National Library of Medicine and with other prominent industry repositories. So we are left with the following pressing, unanswered questions about Prof. Zhengli, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, and the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan: Why are the Chinese authorities seemingly ignoring the Wuhan Institute Virology’s contemporaneous coronavirus study (culminating in a Dec. 11, 2019 report, published the day before the outbreak) conducted at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, located just 8.6 miles distant from the claimed epicenter of pandemic origin, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market? Why is the media not reporting this? Why are most media reports covering the coronavirus still misreporting the source of the virus’ genome sequence as snakes instead of bats? Since the Wuhan Institute of Virology has already isolated live, novel SARS-like Coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 from bat droppings in 2016, and such virus has been confirmed to invade the host cells through the ACE2 of human beings just like the new, emergent Coronavirus 2019-nCoV — have the two coronaviruses been compared with each other?
Corona Virus – Made In China. 	"Chinese appetites have horrified us for a long time, not to mention their extreme cruelty to all animals. Now, apparently thanks to them chowing down on live-fried bats, snakes, raw living baby mice and who knows what, bought from disgusting unhygienic markets, the world faces a new plague.
Scientists analysing the Corona virus have discovered that it jumped the species barrier from bats to either snakes or some other species and now to humans.
Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).
The disease is in many ways like an especially deadly flu, and it is considered a serious threat to world health, as it may easily become a pandemic.
A dramatic reduction in the world population, especially in the areas where there are burgeoning useless eaters would be good for the planet and everything else living on it provided it doesn’t harm the White Race particularly.
Nevertheless it is reasonable to take care and to be disgusted with the habits of the Chinese who have brought this threat into existence.
Despite their reputedly high intelligence, the Chinese show little sense in the way they handle health issues. They will continue with their gruesome diets, including eating aborted babies , while the government lies about the numbers of victims and forbids doctors, on pain of serious prosecution, from getting the truth out. One such doctor was arrested and subsequently has died of the virus.
The levels of pollution in China from industrial sources are also very harmful to their health and will make people more vulnerable to the disease.
Since China has a dictatorship and is not a democracy the government has the ability to act quickly and decisively on any threats to the population, and yet they cannot seem to get their act together. China likes to present itself, both to its own people and to the world, as a far better organised country than in fact is the case. If China was a democracy this would only be much worse though. No one would take responsibility, decisions would be hampered by political popularity contests, together with corruption going through the roof.
As happened in the Soviet Union with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the Chinese government is embarrassed about coronavirus and afraid that the truth will panic their population, make the officials “lose face” and similarly make China look bad to the outside world.
While the true numbers of those affected are certainly much higher than the Chinese are claiming, we can expect cover-ups by the governments of all other countries as well. They want to keep the workers carrying on going to work, minimise and potential for panic and also are concerned that people are becoming “racist” towards the Chinese . They would prefer a huge death toll than to risk anyone becoming “racist” in much the same way as mass sexual abuse of girls in Britain by “Asian grooming gangs” (not Chinese but mainly Pakistani) has been (still is) covered up because it is better the girls are raped than that people would be wary of the sort of men that pose a risk and therefore be “racist” .
While there is some possibility that the coronavirus turns out to be a biological warfare agent, this remains unlikely. However it is disconcerting that the Chinese are presently using HIV medicines to treat victims and that the virus has an extraordinary similarity to HIV in its structure. If the virus is bio warfare it could either be that it escaped from Chinese stocks or is an attack by another country. It is easy to see why this idea is played down to the public so we can’t really know how likely it is.
Many people are now boycotting Chinese products. There is a possibility the virus could be caught from imports from China that may be contaminated. Then there is the fact that as people look into the whole issue of buying anything from China they realise that it is a bad idea. They are disgusted by the human and animal rights issues and there is the poor quality and safety standards plus the fact that it is better to buy more local items which are likely to employ your own people and be ethically produced. The Chinese economy will be hit hard for sure.
The best policy to stay safe is to avoid all things Chinese and to eat a healthy diet, get the right amount of sleep, wash your hands after going anywhere and stay cheerful as stress is not good for the immune system.
If you are in optimal health then you could even catch coronavirus and shake it off without any symptoms at all.

Corona Virus. 	"The virus is a relative of “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” (SARS), another coronavirus virus that hit in 2002. Experts are currently saying that the new virus is not as severe as the 2002 outbreak, although it may be more contagious. So far, that’s not too bad.
China has quarantined more than 35 million people and stopped all travel in or out of Wuhan during the busy Chinese New Year season. China has also announced that it plans to build a 1,000-bed hospital within a week to treat coronavirus.
Those stories either indicate that China is taking very seriously its responsibility to its people and to the world at large to stop an inconvenient and somewhat dangerous virus from spreading or it means that the Chinese government is scared and panicking.
One nurse in China says it’s the latter. The nurse, wearing heavy protective garb that hides her identity, has published a video claiming that 90,000 people have the coronavirus in Wuhan
I am here to tell the truth. At this moment, Hubei Province (including the Wuhan area), even China, 90,000 people have been infected by corona virus so far.
How much do you know about corona virus? If a person who is infected with coronavirus, if you can’t isolate someone who is infected with the virus, if you can’t make the right treatment to them, at least 14 people will be infected by that virus at once. That means 14 people who already infected times 14 people sooner or later.
Now we are having the Chinese New Year. Every Chinese wants to go back home. We want to have some time with family. We want to have some dinner together. However, we are in a special situation right now.
I would like to say that everyone who is currently watching this video should not go outside. Don’t party. Do not eat out. Once a year, we celebrate Chinese New Year. If you are safe now, you will be able to meet again your family healthy next year.
Let’s talk about the current medical situation in Hubei (including Wuhan). At the present, all medical systems in Hubei. . . . We don’t care what the government says, I will tell you through social media. Everyone, please donate masks, glasses, and clothes to Wuhan. Please help us. Please donate disposable goggles, disposable masks, and disposable clothing.
Currently all resources are not enough. Now all the doctors in all the hospitals in Wuhan area now, on the front line to prevent coronavirus. We are all standing at the deadline.
I want everyone watching this video to pay attention to what I say. I will say it again. Please do not go outside during the Chinese New Year. The reason I work so hard is I want my mother and my whole family to be healthy. I hope you understand everything what I say.
Some family members, relatives, friends, and some people aren’t getting this news right now. If you are watching this video, please spread this video away. We must be aware of this issue. This is a political challenge. (It seems the government keep the secret about this issue.)
We should inform everyone that coronavirus is now growing up to secondary mutation. In other words, first-generation mutations can cure symptoms. But, if a second-generation mutation occurs, something really terrible happens will come. That’s because the infection is not just for one person, but for everyone around you (at least 10 people). If so, coronavirus will explode.
I will ask again. Never go out and do not eat out. Thank you very much.
You may want to stock up on disinfecting gel. Also, don’t eat bats, mice, or snakes . They are more likely to be disease vectors than our domesticated animals, which have been bred for human diets and are raised, slaughtered, and cooked in ways that minimize disease.
Meanwhile, the inimitable Paul Joseph Watson points out that, even now, both to “save the planet” and to show sophistication, the Left is encouraging Americans to eat animals not normally part of the Western diet and contending that saying otherwise is racist."
BASKETBALL: New Albany grad, hoops Hall of Famer dies from COVID-19. 	"Siegel was a three-year letterwinner in basketball, track and cross country at New Albany, which he graduated from in 1950. He was a member of the school’s first boys’ basketball team to play in the IHSAA State Finals. Lafayette Jeff edged the Bulldogs and Siegel 41-39 in overtime in the second semifinal of the ‘50 state finals at then-Butler Fieldhouse.
After graduating from NAHS, Siegel was a four-year letterman in basketball at Franklin College. He later got into coaching and had stops at now-defunct Stillwell, Southwestern (Shelby), Boonville and Indianapolis Pike. He had his most success with the Red Devils.
“My High School Coach Ed Seigel [sic] lost his battle to the virus today,” former Pike standout LaSalle Thompson III wrote on Facebook on Wednesday.
Thompson, who played collegiately at Indiana State and Ball State in the 1990s, went on to write that Siegel “was and will ALWAYS BE MORE THAN A COACH!!! HE WAS A FATHER FIGURE!!! He played a tremendous role in my life in helping me become the man I am today! I will always be grateful for the time we had & shared!”
Siegel ranks 49th in state history with 458 career victories. His teams won six sectional and two regional titles.
Governor Eric Holcomb had Siegel as a teacher at Pike and wrote a lengthy Facebook post about him Thursday.
“For anyone who ever had Ed Siegel in class or on the court, yesterday, we lost a legend to heaven’s call,” Holcomb wrote. “If you knew this larger than life Indianapolis Pike High School teacher & coach, please take a knee in prayer for the Siegel family. ‘Coach’ commanded attention whether you liked it or not, especially if you were a referee.
“As his students, we revered him. We looked forward to ‘Econ’ class because of his presence, more so than the subject matter of the day. He was a quote machine. One of the last things he ever said to me was, ‘Holcomb, you could never jump over a dime’, and of course he was right. We always hung onto his every word and wanted to live up to his expectation for ourselves. Besides, he demanded it.
“For many, his influence was next to parental. He gave his heart and soul to Indiana and the game Hoosiers are famous for around the world.
“It’s only fitting he played such an integral role in establishing the Indiana High School Basketball Hall of Fame.
“There will never be another like Coach Ed Siegel.
“We will miss him and honor his legacy by still seeking to never let him down.” "
Gilead Sciences Disputes Claim That Remdesivir Failed in a COVID-19 Trial. 	"Gilead Sciences ( NASDAQ:GILD ) issued a statement Friday disputing reports that its antiviral drug remdesivir was found to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in a clinical trial conducted in China.
News of the alleged clinical trial failure started making the rounds this week after a summary of data from the study was accidentally posted on the World Health Organization website. The data was eventually taken down, but not before many pundits jumped to conclusions as to the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of remdesivir. But in response, Gilead Sciences Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said that ""the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study.""
The study in question was supposed to involve patients with mild manifestations of COVID-19. However, the trial ended early due to low enrollment. Parsey said that the data from this trial is currently being peer-reviewed, and Gilead Sciences should provide an update on it soon. Also, according to Parsey, the data from the trial was actually encouraging: ""[T]rends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early."" Image Source: Getty Images.
Whatever investors make of all this, it is essential to note that remdesivir has shown some promise. STAT, a news website that focuses on the healthcare industry , recently reported that in a sample of 125 COVID-19 patients treated at University of Chicago Medicine with remdesivir (including 113 patients with severe cases of the disease), most of them recovered and were released from the hospital, while only two died.
However, that data was from only one section of a larger study, and has not yet been formally released. Until Gilead Sciences publishes full results from formal clinical trials, investors would be well-advised to take all such reports -- both positive and negative -- with a grain of salt. "

2019 Novel Corona Virus: Will Ayurveda Again Serve to be A Clinical Protocol?. 	 The recent outbreak of Corona Virus Epidemic has caused considerable distress and morbidity among the affected population. The current treatment measures are helping just to certain extent while no satisfactory treatment regimen is available for managing sequelae of acute phase.2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), most commonly known as Coronavirus, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. It was detected as a cause of respiratory sickness outbreaks in Wuhan (Capital of Hubei Province), China. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species. Coronavirus is an infectious disease that can be transmitted between animals to humans and human-to-human. The novel coronavirus infection that first broke out in Wuhan, China, has spread to 25 countries so far. As on 4th Feb, 2020 , at least 361 deaths and 17,205 cases of the virus have been reported from China while new infections are being reported around the world. The WHO reported 146 confirmed cases in 23 countries outside China including 3 cases in Kerala, India. Symptoms and Diagnosis A common sign of infection includes respiratory symptoms, cough, fever, breathing difficulties or shortness of breath and diarrhea. Infection can cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome, pneumonia, kidney failure and even death in more severe cases. It is estimated that it takes 2 to 10 days from exposure to onset of symptoms by the World Health Organization. Analysis of the recent out breaks has suggested that the increased severity of the disease may be due to a change in genetic sequence and the virus attacks on cells and begins replicating to cause an Infection. It all depends on the virus’s lifecycle and replication rate that how fast the virus spreads throughout the body. It rearranges the membrane of cells and stimulates them to fuse together. This process causes sufficient damage to host tissues to shut down the body’s immune system, to fight with viruses, infections and other diseases. Treatment and Vaccination Unfortunately, the vaccination is under investigation and not available for Novel Coronavirus. The efforts are already underway by global organizations, governments, and private companies, but it may take months. There is no specific management for Novel Coronavirus. Vaccine. Symptomatic treatment is recommended. The line of management is usually the rest, Intravenous fluids, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Correlation of Ayurveda and Siddha Medicine with Preventive Measures Ayurveda - the science of life, and Siddha - means achievements, the twin medicine system in India are the comprehensive system of health care of ancient wisdom, based on experiential knowledge and grown with perpetual additions. Original dimensions of Ayurveda are in built in the ancient compendia of Indian wisdom called Vedas, which are believed to be documented around 6000 years back. About 65% of population in India is reported to use Ayurveda and medicinal plants to help meet their primary health care needs and the safety of this vibrant tradition is attributed to time tested use and textual reference. The concept of epidemics is very well defined and established in Ayurveda and Siddha. Acharya Charaka (1500BC - 400AD), the great physician of Ayurveda had mentioned epidemic conditions under the head ‘ Janapadodwamsa”. The contamination and vitiation of various factors like– Jala (water), Vayu (air ), Desha (place) and Kala (season), are considered to be responsible for the production of communicable diseases which can be well correlated with modern science. Susruta (1500BC-500AD) has very clearly defined such diseases under Oupasargika roga i.e., communicable diseases. Numerous methods of prevention and controls of epidemics, measures for environmental sanitation finds an important place in Ayurvedic and Siddha literatures. It has also been mentioned that the natural course of disease and its treatment may vary according to the period, geographical extent, eco-climatic conditions, and psychosomatic constitution of an individual and so on. Certain new disease entities may also appear in the course of time that has no identity and they may be managed through suitable drugs and procedures based on the symptom profile, taking leads from authentic literatures. This provides us basic ideology of creating an evidence on safety and efficacy through Reverse pharmacology. Today water borne diseases, environmental diseases, epidemiological disorders and seasonal disorders due to infections can be correlated with Janapadodhwamsa Vyadhis . Evidence of Contagious Disease Treatment By Ayurveda Various communicable diseases like Chikanguniya, Dengue , Swine flu etc. which were declared as global emergencies earlier, The observations drawn from medical camps and documented reports collected from various parts of the country revealed that the Ayurveda and Siddha regimens certainly has a role in cure and management of the symptoms of these diseases effectively. This would immensely help for taking forward the leads from Ayurveda and Siddha for further scientific validation on safety and efficacy in the Coronavirus condition also through systematic experimental and clinical studies. Ayurveda and Siddha offers number of single drugs, compound herbal and herbo-mineral combinations, may be rationally used to combat such conditions. It is evident from above description that the Ayurveda has an enormous knowledge of mode of spread, nature of microorganism and how to combat the disease long back. The krimis, bhutas, grahas , rakshas and their agantuka nidana are all microorganisms may be virus, bacterial and fungal organisms. Charaka has given three main processes for treating the krimi rogas : (1) These are Nidana parivarjana (to avoid the factors responsible for the production of disease), (2) Apakarshana (removal of krimi from the affected site) and (3) Prakriti Vighata (changing the environment, which favorable for the growth of microbes). In Siddha system of medicine, the treatment modalities are categorized into (a) Symptom modifiers- to say the drugs which improve the Quality of Life providing strength or resistance against the disease such as Jvara hara (anti pyretic) ; Sotha hara (anti-inflammatory); Vedanaa hara (analgesics) ; Kasa hara (anti tussive) ; Swasa hara (anti dyspnoeic); Atisara hara (anti diarrheal) etc., (b) General health promoters - the agents that alleviate symptoms and facilitate early recovery such as Balya (Tonic) and Rasayana (Immunomodulator) (c) Vector control measures/agents -that are mostly physical measures for environmental cleanliness like Dhoopana ( for Fumigation) and Bhuthaghna & Rakshoghna (Anti- microbial agents). The concept seems to be very similar to modern microbiology and practice of medicine. Though there is no direct reference of Coronavirus, but it can be equated with the prevailing conditions to some extent. How Ayurvedic Products Can Prevent? It is always necessary to take action before it is late. As a preventive measure, some of the herbo-minerals like, Holy Basil, Giloy (Heart-Leaved Moonseed) Amla, Winter Cherry, Turmeric etc, produce the antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect and effective in all age groups, for stronger immunity , better digestion healthy liver functioning, metabolism, and a balanced hormonal function. There are a lot of Ayurvedic formulations available to cleanse the toxins, and provide nourishment, lubricate and reinstate the balance. This process increases immunity and protects the body against viruses and infections. Ayurvedic products like herbal immunity booster can help boost overall immunity, which helps protect the body against viruses, bacteria, fungi, infections and even parasites, and empowers energy and resistance. These immune system boosters are usually designed by natural herbs to promote increased energy and helps aid in your body’s ability to fight infection. They help to keep illnesses away and provides optimal immune defense. Best Herbal Immunity Booster Ayurvedic formulations with immune-boosting properties are available in tablets, capsules, supplements and tonics, which promotes overall health and well-being. But finding a trustworthy and reliable product is all that matters. Bio Immunoboosters Capsule by BIOAYURVEDA (One of the biggest Ayurvedic brands) is one of the most reliable immunity system booster, formulated by completely pure ingredients such as Giloy (Heart-Leaved Moonseed, Amla, Turmeric, Green Chiretta, Black Pepper, Moringa, Dry Ginger and many more natural herbs that helps to sustain immunity with its anti-inflammatory properties. It helps in enhancing the function of white body cells that fights infections. It helps in improving the body's response to respiratory infections and improves digestive health. It works remarkably well in activating the immune system to bring overall wellness. Some More Necessary Safety Measures Ayurveda always recommend Diet and Life style adoption, i.e (a) Ahara (Diet) -Always have homemade fresh food, plenty of lukewarm liquids, light and warm diet, liberally use ginger and turmeric in foods Always avoid food prepared under unhygienic conditions, contaminated and stale food, Cold drinks, beverage, etc. (b) Vihara (Lifestyle)- Avoid visiting the disease prevalent areas (c) Proper sanitation measures to be followed like Regular hand washing with soap and water, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, stay home when you are sick, clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, etc. are the common recommendations to avoid infection spread. Avoid intimate contact with any person showing signs of respiratory sickness like cough and sneezing Coronavirus is an epidemic disorder, there should be continuous upgrading of the knowledge about the infection, transmission, control, virus, vector and epidemiology. As this disease is mainly related to public health, the research has to be focused on the geographical extent and spread of the infection, and further research is needed to standardize these formulations by developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), pharmacopoeia standards, stability studies and establishing the safety data of these formulations along with scientific evidences. Various Health Departments has to be actively engaged in patient care, patient education, community education which also includes, organizing various preventive and curative medical camps to tackle this disaster and health menace globally.
Coastal Bend College adjusting to operating online during COVID-19 pandemic. 	"The Coastal Bend College has switched its operation during this pandemic, but they want to remind students that they are still here to help.
President of The Coastal Bend College Justin Hoggard says all classes are currently virtual which has impacted some hands-on labs, but he does not expect it to affect the academic calendar.
Hoggard says registration for the summer and fall semester has already begun.Hoggard says resources for students are still available either over the phone or online.Although the school has adapted during this crisis, he says he still misses the presence of students on campus.
“I miss that interaction with the students and just being able to sit down at lunch and be able to talk to them. It's a major shift, hopefully soon we'll get back to normal.” Said Hoggard.
Hoggard says they haven't finalized plans for this semester's commencement ceremony, but details on that will be out soon. "

COVID-19: Mushrooming suppliers of PPEs pose quality problems. 	The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases across the country coupled with a shortage of protective gear for the medical community and relief workers has created a small boom on the supply side – unfortunately not always with great results. The biggest shortage is of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and high quality masks (commonly known as N95 mask that 3M makes). While existing manufacturers have ramped up production to meet demand, a set of new manufacturers have jumped in to help mitigate shortage. The problem is with the cottage industries that have sprung up by slapping togther various components such as gloves, foot covers, eyeglasses while the protective suit itself is stiched in strange shapes and material. Since these are offered at prices as low at Rs350 plus, we are also seeing a rush among well-intentioned donors, who do not seem to be checking for certification and quality – especially when they are being supplied to hospitals for use by medical profesisonals The poor quality PPE suits are also coming in from China. According to a report 170,000 PPE kits that arrived in India on April 5, about 50,000 failed quality tests. Fortunately, the Union Health Ministry however has issued specific guidelines to stipulate which materials constitute a PPE. These include items like Head Gear, Goggles, Face-Shield, Mask, Gloves, Gown and Shoe-cover made from specified materials. In order to fight this issue of “fake” PPEs, Maharashtra had recently announced that PPE kits and N-95 masks made by private firms cannot be sold unless certified by the state-run Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals Corporation. While the state has justified this as a means to check the quality of masks and other essentials, manufacturers, hospitals as well as donor organisations lost a precious week over the confusion caused and the process. The Mumbai municipal corporation has now taken charge of quality checks and approving what goes out to hospitals, says a doctor from one of Mumbai’s leading government hospitals who is deeply involved in coordinating supplies for the hospital. He says, on one particular day, 63 samples were submitted and more than half were rejected. Meanwhile high quality products are indeed available, but the price of PPEs has been as high as Rs 1500 to Rs 2500, while the asking rate for N95 masks was anywhere from Rs 210 for bulk orders to Rs 395 at the retail level. Moneylife Foundation, which has been donating N 95 masks had also purchased them as high as Rs175, before being able to connect with Venus Safety and Health, a Taloja based company that has been producing a wide range of masks and other medical safety equipment of high quality. Venus is now hugely over-booked with large chunks of its production being cranked out for government hospitals, but has been selling at less than a third the price of our initial purchase. Interestingly, sources connected with the company point out that they are finally getting due recognition for their products and quality. Until recently, when cheap imports from China were available in plenty, neither doctors nor hospitals wanted to pay attention to a local manufacturer, even though their products were equally good. Moneylife Foundation had a similar experience with Paras Trading Corporation which is being run by the Jhaveri family, operating out of TTC Industrial area at Pawne, Navi Mumbai. We zeroed in on it as one of the first PPE manufacturers to be cleared by Haffkine and one that was offering fair price and quick delivery. Since our supplies are for medical professionals there was always a concern about quality, given the range of safety equipment being bombarded by a wide spectrum of suppliers – from the most dubious to very expensive. In the circumstances, it was gratifying for us to receive a call from a leading Mumbai hospital to say they were very happy with the products supplied and wanted to contact the company to place a direct order. The foundation’s experience with protective face shields for medical professionals has been equally onerous. In late March and early April, when the need for protective gear as well as shortages were at their peak, we have bought face shields at as much as Rs175 plus GST. As more manufacturers jumped into the fray and began 3-D printing of faceshields, prices have dropped to a third. And even less for really big bulk purchases. The Corona pandemic has truly been a big boom opportunity for some business and many have not hesitated to take full advantage of the panic and the shortages. Sadly enough, this is at the cost of donor organisations that have garnered public funds to help protect our medical warriors. But it is now time to step back and take stock –in the week of April 20, the larger government hospitals as well as designated COVID hospitals, we learn, have finally begun to receive government and supplies of protective gear. It may not meet 100% of what medical workers and doctors would want, but the acute shortage and panic has eased. However, the situation remains dire for smaller, peripheral hospitals including maternity hospitals are in danger of becoming the next hot spot, since patients affected by community spread of the virus walk in there.
Corona Virus. 	#2 I'm sorry, but this pure is scare tactics. The corona virus is a common flu virus. Are nations taking steps to control the spread of this virus? Yes. But that does not mean that the virus is a death notice if you get sick from it. The death rate is less than .02 %. It is a type of flu, and those with compromised health issues are those with the greatest risk. While this outbreak is serious, it is a type of common flu. The common flu can infect large numbers of people. We DO get flu outbreaks this time each year. It is prudent to try to prevent the spread of the virus. It is not the Black Death. Mr. Cotton is big on scare, supposedly this is some Chinese biological weapons program gone wrong. While he's big on scare, he's awfully light on proof.
Dr Gabriel Cousens : Corona Virus Update.. 	"Dear Friends,
Yesterday, in multiple places, virologists identified that the Wuhan coronavirus out of China was laboratory engineered. Multiple virology laboratories around the world have basically confirmed that the fingerprint of genetic modification vectors is unmistakably present in this coronavirus gene sequence. In other words, the remnants of gene-engineering tools for the genetic insertion are still present in virus samples. One of the first laboratories to discover this was a top research institute in India called the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences. Their analysis of the RNA sequence revealed that part of the HIV virus was inserted into this coronavirus. Notably, the appearance of any aspect of the HIV virus in another coronavirus has never occurred before. Such a discovery is analogous to finding a jackalope.
The mythical mash-up jackalope and the Wuhan coronavirus share some commonalities. This particular HIV segment allows it to better plug into the mucus membranes of the human system, giving it a rare entry mechanism not found in any other coronavirus. Scientists in other laboratories worldwide, including a well-known virologist in Beijing, China, point out that this coronavirus has been unmistakably human engineered. He mentions a SARS binding protein sequence that also allows it entry into human cells. The same scientist points out that at this time of the year no bats are sold or found at the Wuhan seafood market. Forty-five percent of the initial people who came down with the virus had not visited the Wuhan seafood market, clearly showing that the speculation that the virus spread through the Wuhan seafood market is completely bogus. It is interesting to note that a variety of virology laboratories from different countries have confirmed that this virus is human engineered.
Though my initial intuition was that the virus had accidentally escaped from the Wuhan laboratory located 20 miles away from the marketplace, the virus was not found in a bat in the marketplace. This has been more seriously validated in the last 48 hours. It is also my interpretation that the weaponized virus was accidentally released at this time. It's important to understand that viruses have legitimately accidentally been released from laboratories in a variety of unexpected ways. Historically, there may be close to 10 virus research laboratories in the US, alone, where this has happened. The question that humanity must answer is,
""Why are we manufacturing human lethal bioweapons in the level 3 and 4 research centers around the world?""
Not only have we demonstrated our inability to handle them in ways that don't prevent accidental releases, but the very idea of creating these lethal bioweapons is antithetical to the great, moral, and ethical wisdom and Biblical teachings. Going against the divine purpose of life is going against God. At some point we need to stop this insane behavior from continuing.
Just because this virus is lab-grown, doesn't mean we shouldn't take it seriously. On the contrary it is crucial that we meet exposure with an enhanced health regime and protocol.
To protect and enhance our natural immunity, I want to add several items to my Wuhan Coronavirus Protection Protocol:
Illumodine - 20 drops in a glass of water 3 times daily (15 minutes or more away from food) (Iodine has been shown to destroy SARS and MRSA viruses and, in its atomic form [Illumodine] is probably the most powerful antiviral on the planet.) Nano Silver - 1 teaspoon twice daily (Nano Silver has been shown to destroy SARS and MRSA viruses.) Red Algae - 2 capsules twice daily such as on waking and bedtime (away from food)
*Illumodine, Nano Silver, and Red Algae are the top 3 antivirals.*
Mega Defense - 4 capsules twice daily (for building and protecting the immune system) Antioxidant Extreme - 2 capsules twice daily Licorice Root - take as tea or tincture once daily (for lung protection) Vitamin D - 2,000 IU daily (for building the immune system) Vitamin A - 25,000 IU daily (for protecting our upper respiratory mucus membranes and lining) Vitamin C - as much as you can take before diarrhea
It is unfortunate that we need to be in such a survival defense situation. It is my prayer that these lethal, viral, weaponized attacks against humanity may finally be exposed, and humanity may actually push back against this evil activity.
Blessings and Health to Everyone, Gabriel Cousens, MD, MD(H), ND(hc), DD "
Government health agency official: Corona virus 'isn't something the American public need to worry about'. 	"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said Sunday the American public shouldn’t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China.
“It’s a very, very low risk to the United States,” Fauci said during an interview with radio show host John Catsimatidis.
“But it’s something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously... It isn’t something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about. Because we have ways of preparing and screening of people coming in [from China]. And we have ways of responding - like we did with this one case in Seattle, Washington, who had traveled to China and brought back the infection.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Saturday that there are 1,320 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, only two are in the U.S. and the majority are centered in China.
Fauci went on to explain that since it is a virus, there are limited remedies to combat it or develop immunity among a population. He said NIAID is working on a vaccine, though it will be about three months until they can begin testing it on humans.
“We’ve just got to make sure that we are totally prepared [since] infectious diseases will continue to emerge on the human species. And we’ve got to be essentially perpetually prepared.”
It remains unclear how long the virus will be active in China, where over 30 million people in the Wuhan, China area have been quarantined so far.
On Saturday, it was reported that the U.S. government is preparing a charter flight this weekend to evacuate American citizens and diplomats from Wuhan.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Saturday that it is moving a qualifying event from Wuhan, China, to Amman, Jordan, over concerns about the outbreak.

Coronavirus: US President Donald Trump suggests 'injecting disinfectant' to treat COVID-19, 'clean the lungs'. 	"Donald Trump suggests injecting disinfectant could be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Credits: Video - The White House; Image - Reuters
Being injected with disinfectant could be an effective treatment for COVID-19, US President Donald Trump has bizarrely claimed during a disastrous press conference from the White House.
Trump made the comment after Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official Bill Bryan gave a presentation on research his team has carried out, which showed the coronavirus does not live as long in humidity or warmer temperatures.
After Bryan explained that the virus dies quickest in sunlight, Trump suggested there may be some way to ""[bring] the light inside the body"".

""And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that too.
""I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure [COVID-19]. Maybe you can, maybe you can't - I'm not a doctor, but I'm a person who has a good you know what,"" he said, pointing to his head.

Disinfectant is effective at killing pathogens like COVID-19, but can lead to poisoning or even death if it is ingested - a point New Zealand scientist Dr Michelle Dickinson was eager to get across after watching the briefing.

""This is because drinking them can kill them so it keeps our kids safe! This is also the reason why we don't inject disinfectants into people.""
It's not the first time Trump has touted unproven treatments as potential cures for COVID-19. Earlier this month he said hydroxychloroquine could be a ""game-changer"", despite health authorities in the US warning against its use.
The comments capped off a calamitous coronavirus briefing for Trump, who also got in a spat with a Washington Post journalist who challenged him on the medical basis for the treatments he was suggesting.
""I'm the President, and you're fake news,"" he told Philip Rucker. ""I know the guy, I see what he writes - he's a total faker.""
The President also claimed that ""numerous"" world leaders had called him in the last 48 hours to say the US was ""leading the way"" with its COVID-19 response, despite the US recording the highest number of confirmed cases (887,000) and deaths (50,000) from COVID-19 in the world.

Delhi Police ASI tests positive for Covid-19, 3 colleagues quarantined. 	" A worker sanitizes police barricades during the nationwide lockdown imposed in wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  A Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector tested positive for novel coronavirus , following which his three colleagues were sent for home-quarantine, officials said on Friday.
According to a senior police officer, the ASI is posted with the Crime Branch office at Kotwali and tested positive on Thursday. He was later shifted to the staff quarters in Mandoli prison premises.
The police suspect that the ASI got infected from a family in his neighbourhood in Shahdara which had positive cases.
Three police officers who used to share the office room with the infected jawan have been sent for home-quarantine, the officer said.
When the ASI complained about the amenities at the quarantine centre in northeast Delhi where he was kept after being tested positive, he was shifted to a private hospital in south Delhi on Friday morning, the officer added.
The Delhi Police has sanctioned Rs 1 lakh each to its personnel who have tested positive for coronavirus while on duty, officials said on Friday.
As many as 21 Delhi Police personnel have tested positive for the novel coronavirus which include 14 from Central district, six from northwest district and one from the traffic police.
The police headquarters will arrange the payment from the Delhi Police Welfare Society for the personnel expeditiously through the DCPs concerned, according to a letter."
Is China suppressing the corona virus infections!. 	China is facing accusations from the world community of suppressing and playing down the coronavirus outbreak and the scale of infections which some reports say now I as high as 90,000 while the official Beijing figure is just 1,975.International media reports have said cited a nurse treating coronavirus sufferers in China who claims 90,000 people have already been infected.A nurse wearing a protective suit and face mask treating the sick in Wuhan has claimed that 90,000 people have already been infected by the coronavirus.However, the nurse's report has been viewed almost two million times on YouTube. In the footage, she warns people not to go outside and to refrain from celebrating the Chinese New Year.The animal virus epidemic originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,970 people and killed 56, and has spread worldwide.International critics are saying that the China is censoring the numbers and sanitising videos from the internet.China's President Xi Jinping has already warned of 'grave situation' as killer coronavirus accelerates.American cities are on high alert as two coronavirus cases are confirmed in Chicago and Washington while 1,000 Americans have been told to evacuate Ground Zero in Wuhan.Canadian authorities on Saturday confirmed the first case of coronavirus - a man in his 50s from Toronto.The countries which have reported these cases include Singapore, Malaysaia, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Nepal, France, Canada, the US, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.But the Global Times revealed that vital resources, including masks and goggles, were urgently needed.The accusations of a cover-up echo the furore surrounding the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002 when the government concealed the existence of the illness not just from the outside world but from its own people.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday declared a virus emergency in the city of 7.3 million, extending school cancellations until February 17 and cancelling all official visits to mainland China.China has quarantined three cities in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus -- encompassing a total population of some 35 million people.Other reports say several cities are under lockdown with a combined population of 47 million including Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Jingzhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Xianning, Huangshi, Dangyang, Enshi, Xiaogan.Jingmen and Shantou.Reports say that Wuhan continues to be under complete lockdown.

Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected Patients. 	"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (“S-Trimer”) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag © technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.
“I am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses”.
“We are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.”

About Trimer-Tag © Technology
Trimer-Tag © is an innovative drug development platform which allows the production of novel, covalently-trimerized fusion proteins. Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.
About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
The new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus.

"S&P Futures Soar Back To All Time High On Viral ""Corona Cure"" Rumors. "	"As Bloomberg's Richard Breslow writes this morning in a note lamenting that there is ""little obvious"" about this market, ""some days it’s best just to let things play out for a little while. Economic numbers that came out overnight haven’t hurt. Very dovish comments by a senior Bank of Japan official. Upbeat comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. And then the big one, hopeful comments concerning potential progress in dealing with the virus outbreak. And the market has taken off. ""
Indeed, at roughly 3:40am ET, futures surged as much as 30 points, rising to 3,335 and surging just shy of the Jan 22 all time high of 3,337.50, after the following Reuters headline hit: CHINESE TV: RESEARCH TEAM AT ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY HAS FOUND AN EFFECTIVE DRUG TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH THE NEW CORONA VIRUS
Even though Reuters itself said it has not confirmed the veracity of the report, it was enough to unleash a case of viral (or is that virus) optimism, with futures filling the gap back to all time highs, as algos bought first and asked questions, well never. And in typical broken market fashion, two hours later, when a WHO spokesperson, asked about a coronavirus treatment breakthrough, said there are no known effective therapeutics against the virus, futures barely dipped, or to summarize Dow futs up 300 point on unconfirmed optimism, and down 50 on reality.
What is notable is that Chinese state media first covered this yesterday but was largely ignored by mainstream media; the report got a second wind this morning today however after traders focused on the fact that over 900 people have recovered from the coronavirus, which some took for evidence the treatment is becoming more effective, while ignoring that the 500 or so deaths reported so far is likely are greatly underrepresented number by China which has been burning the vast majority of casualties to literally eliminate the evidence.
Optimism was also boosted by a separate Sky News report which said U.K. scientists made significant progress for a vaccine by reducing a part of the normal development time from ""two to three years to just 14 days""; the scientist added that it will be in animal models by the beginning of next week, and the next phase will be to move from early animal testing into the first human studies, which could happen in ""months"", with the report adding that the vaccine will be too late for this current outbreak but it will be crucial if there is another one . though human trials wouldn’t begin for a few months ; at roughly the same time news hit that Chinese researchers have applied for a local patent on an experimental Gilead drug that they believe might fight the coronavirus.
""Traders have taken the view that the situation is now more likely to be under control and hopefully the spread of the health crisis will be stemmed,"" said David Madden, market analysts at CMC Markets.
But what is the reality on any vaccine? Stated simply, it would take months of trials before anything legitimate got off the ground. In short, nothing that hit overnight provides any indication the world is remotely closer to having an effective means to slowing the current pandemic, but all algos cared about was the optimism that was unleashed by the reports, and lo and behold, we are back to all time highs.
Meanwhile, stocks also rallied on bad news, as expectations of more central bank stimulus lifted world stocks to their highest in more than a week on Wednesday with the MSCI global benchmark rising 0.3%, helping investors look past a mounting coronavirus death toll and policymakers’ concerns for the disease’s economic impact.
The unconfirmed report and the stimulus expectations offset at least partly the news that the virus’s death toll had killed 500 and sickened 25,000.
So as a result of both good and bad news, futures on all US indexes turned sharply higher and Europe's Stoxx 600 Index rebounded after a string of reports on possible vaccines or treatments for the deadly pathogen. Contracts on the S&P 500 Index climbed as Tuesday’s the surge in tech stocks continued in premarket trading for Apple and Nvidia. Gilead Sciences edged lower after jumping this week on speculation over its antiviral drug.
Data also showed euro zone and UK business activity accelerated last month, though the figures are now meaningless as the surveys were collected before the coronavirus spread much beyond China. The concerns for economic growth were reflected in signals from the Bank of Japan and the Monetary Authority of Singapore that they were ready to ease policy. BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe pledged not to rule out any option, including lowering already-negative interest rates; meanwhile in Thailand, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates to a record low 1.0% as the economy has been hard hit by the Coronavirus.
“Clearly... all the central banks are ready to act if necessary,” said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.
Earlier in Asia, stocks notched their first back-to-back daily gain in two weeks and headed for their best two-day gain in almost two months as investors assessed earnings releases in the region and the latest status of the coronavirus outbreak, even as quarantines were set up in the Chinese base of iPhone maker Foxconn, at land borders with Hong Kong, on a cruise ship off Japan and U.S. military bases. The region’s benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped as much as 0.8%, with most markets trading in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index had its best two-day advance since June, while the ChiNext Index rose another 3% in a continued rebound after the post-holiday slump. Japan’s Topix index advanced as Mitsubishi Corp. and Itochu Corp. climbed after reporting quarterly earnings that beat estimates. China (PBOC) is also likely to lower its key rate on Feb. 20, sources told Reuters. while Thailand unexpectedly cut interest rates.
In rates, 10-year Treasury yields rose three basis points to 1.637% while German yields rose 4 bps to a one-week high. Sovereign bond curves across Europe bear steepened, though Treasuries were harder hit by the sell-off.
In FX, the dollar was roughly unchanged even as 10Y yields rose, while the Australian dollar led gains in G-10; the franc led declines against the greenback with the yen holding little changed after erasing an earlier gain. The pound extended gains after better- than-forecast services U.K. PMI, which also led money markets to price out expectations for BOE rate cuts to less than 25bps
In commodities, crude oil headed for its first gain in six sessions in New York trading: Brent crude also bounced 2.5%, after losing 16% since Jan. 21. It was supported too by expectations OPEC and its allies would cut output to offset lower demand.
Economic data include mortgage applications, trade balance and Markit services PMI. Qualcomm, Boston Scientific and General Motors are due to report earnings.

Top Overnight News from Bloomberg: The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed toward 500 as confirmed cases worldwide almost 25,000. Hong Kong announced plans to quarantine travelers coming from the mainland, while thousands remained stuck on cruise ships Chinese researchers have applied for a local patent on an experimental Gilead Sciences Inc. drug that they believe might fight the novel coronavirus outbreak The euro area’s private sector expanded at a faster- than-anticipated pace in January, providing a foundation for economic growth to accelerate in the course of the year, with a composite Purchasing Managers’ Index rising to the highest since August The Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low as the coronavirus outbreak, a stalled government budget and bad drought imperil economic growth, while most other monetary policy makers have stuck to expressing concern and signaling a willingness to act on risks from the virus. Australian central bank Governor Philip Lowe reinforced expectations that policy makers will refrain from more interest- rate cuts Poland became the first emerging-market sovereign to get paid for borrowing in euros via a syndicated bond deal OPEC+ officials gathered in Vienna for a second day of debate on the impact of the coronavirus, a process that could result in an emergency ministerial meeting where Saudi Arabia would push for an oil-production cut
Asian equity markets were positive across the board as the global rebound filtered through to the region after having underpinned the major indices on Wall St and pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record high . ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were both higher after taking impetus from stateside peers with tech and commodity-related sectors the outperformers in Australia but with gains limited by resistance at the 7000 level and with gold miners suffering as investors shunned safe-havens, while gains in Tokyo were exacerbated by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) notched respectable gains as the bargain hunting resumed in the mainland, unfazed by softer Caixin Services and Composite PMIs, continued increases in the number of coronavirus cases and the PBoC skipping open market operations in which it noted that current liquidity is ample and can fully meet market demand. Finally, 10yr JGBs extended on this week’s pullback from the 153.00 level and following the bear-steepening in USTs in which T-notes retreated below 131.00 as the gains across stocks sapped safe-haven demand.
Top Asian News Singapore Dollar Tumbles After MAS Flags Scope for Decline Hong Kong Will Quarantine Travelers Coming From Mainland China China Virus Shuts Airbus Plant, Hitting Narrow-Body Jet Output Thailand Cuts Interest Rate as Virus Outbreak Hurts Economy
European equities are firmer across the board [Eurostoxx 50 +1.0%] following a tame open, as risk sentiment was bolstered by unconfirmed reports that a research team at a Chinese university has found an ""effective"" drug to treat people with Coronavirus . Moreover, reports via Sky News suggested that a team of UK scientists reduced the normal development timeframe for a vaccine to 14 days from 2-3 years, but crucially, the report noted that the “vaccine will be too late for this current outbreak, but it will be crucial if there is another one."" Nonetheless, bourses have held onto gains with sectors staging a complete turnaround from the open. European sectors now largely reflect risk appetite with defensives lagging cyclicals (ex-healthcare). Movers this morning are mostly orientated around earnings - with DAX heavyweight Siemens (+0.5%) initially opening with earnings-induced losses in excess of 1.5% before conforming to the overall gains in the German bourse. On the flip side, Imperial Brands (-7.8%) rests at the foot of the pan-European index following a profit warning in which it now forecasts a circa 10% drop in H1 profits. Other earnings-led movers include Smurfit Kappa (+7.8%), Barratt Developments (+3.3%), Danske Bank (-0.7%), Novo Nordisk (+1.5%) and Infineon (+9.0%). Elsewhere, Adidas (+1.0%) and Puma (+0.2%) shares opened lower to the tune of around 2% after US peer Nike noted that the coronavirus outbreak is expected to have a “material impact” on its Chinese operations. Adidas’ CEO also echoes some comments from Nike in which it sees a negative impact on its Chinese business, but stopped short of giving details or extent of impacts.

In FX, the Dollar is holding up firm in the face of a marked pick-up in sentiment surrounding China’s coronavirus based on media headlines suggesting that scientists and researchers may be closer to finding a vaccine than previously anticipated. The reports have boosted the YUAN for obvious reasons, with Usd/Cnh retreating from around 7.0100 to sub-6.9750 and below the 200 DMA (6.9905) not to mention the PBoC’s 6.9823 overnight Usd/Cny mid-point fix. However, the Greenback is forging gains at the expense of safer havens, like the YEN, EURO, SWISS FRANC and GOLD, with the DXY clinging to 98.000 and on course to keep its head above a key Fib retracement level (98.011), barring any bad miss via ADP, final Markit PMIs and/or the non-manufacturing ISM. JPY/CHF/EUR/XAU - As noted above, all weaker vs the Buck and overall on a broad unwind of FTQ premium/positioning, as Usd/Jpy climbs further above 109.50, Usd/Chf reclaims 0.9700+ status, Eur/Usd retreats from near 1.1050 to just under 1.1025 and Usd/Xau retests support circa Usd 1550/oz after briefly tripping stops on a break of Tuesday’s low (Usd 1549) to trade a whisker below Usd 1548. AUD/GBP/NOK/SEK/NZD/CAD - The Aussie has extended post-RBA gains with the aid of commentary from Governor Lowe reinforcing a wait-and-see stance on top of the more encouraging Chinese outbreak news. Aud/Usd has now climbed firmly back above 0.6750 to revisit late January peaks (0.6777), while Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0400 to the detriment of Nzd/Usd that has not been able to regain a sure grip on the 0.6500 handle in wake of somewhat mixed NZ jobs data. Conversely, another handsome UK PMI beat vs consensus has boosted Sterling across board, as Cable hovers close to best levels of the wtd (1.3070) and Eur/Gbp sub-0.8450 following rather contrasting Eurozone services PMIs. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns have rebounded alongside risk appetite and the Norwegian Krona especially fuelled by a strong recovery in crude prices whereas its Swedish counterpart is being partially hampered by poor hard data offsetting an upbeat services PMI. Similarly, the Loonie is not deriving that much from the aforementioned bounce in oil ahead of Canadian trade data and a speech from BoC’s Wilkins, albeit with Usd/Cad nearer the base of a 1.3299-62 band. EM - Most regional currencies have tracked Yuan and high-beta peer appreciation, but the SGD and THB have both been subject to dovish MAS and Thai CB vibes in the form of guidance and an unexpected 25 bp ease respectively, while the Try is still on the defensive due to geopolitical factors. Conversely, SA Government backing for COSATU proposals to cut Eskom debt have given the Zar and extra fillip.
In commodities, WTI and Brent futures have extended on overnight gains amid the aforementioned reports of seemingly constructive coronavirus headlines. WTI and Brent front-month futures hit fresh 2020 lows (of ~49.30/bbl and 53.70/bbl respectively) in light of a larger than expected headline API inventory build (+4.18mln vs. Exp. +2.8mln). Thereafter, prices clambered off worst levels before piggybacking on the virus headlines which, if true, could significantly improve the demand outlook for the complex. Elsewhere, OPEC’s JTC will convene for the second day of discussions later today after the technical committee reportedly did not discuss production cuts yesterday but will revisit the topic, according to delegates who noted it studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand from the coronavirus. Reports also note that OPEC numbers suggest a circa 400k BPD demand impact for around six months from the coronavirus, although these forecasts are highly contingent on how long the epidemic lasts alongside any prolonged effects. Analysts at ING note that a 500k BPD of additional OPEC cuts in Q1 and a rollover of current cuts in Q2 (through to end-June) should be almost enough to balance the oil market, assuming the OPEC figures are correct and factoring in supply disruptions in Libya. Next up, traders will be eyeing the weekly DoEs with headline crude forecast to print a build of 2.831mln barrels, according to Reuters Estimates. Elsewhere, spot gold conformed to the overall risk appetite as prices briefly dipped below 1550/oz before encountering stops just below the figure. Copper continues yesterday’s sentiment-led rebound as the red metal almost wipes out a bulk of last week’s losses.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap
With coronavirus fears continuing to ease, the last 24 hours have been kind to risk assets once again. The latest numbers show 24,324 cases and 490 deaths as of this morning versus 20,438 and 425 this time yesterday but the fact that there appears to be a slowing in independent incidents in countries outside of China and a slowing in the rate of transmission in cases outside of Wuhan province appear to be making investors more comfortable for now. While this could change, our conclusion was that these were the conditions that needed to be satisfied for markets to feel more at ease following DB’s client call with a virus expert on Monday. For those that missed it the replay details can be found here (link here).
As for markets, coming off the back of 8 sessions where by the S&P 500 flipped between gains and losses, yesterday’s +1.50% return means the index is up +2.23% in the last two sessions. The NASDAQ also rallied +2.10% yesterday - a new record high and the biggest gain since August - and the DOW +1.44% which means all three indices are back in positive territory YTD again. Also worth noting was the +4.11% surge for the NYSE FANG index meaning the index is up an impressive +9.10% in the last two sessions. Even copper – which had been on a 13-session losing run – finally joined the party, rising +1.40%.
At a micro level it was the incredible +13.73% surge for Tesla which really grabbed the spotlight yesterday though. That means the stock is up +36.35% over the last two sessions and 112% this year already. More impressive still is the 435% rally from the 2019 lows. With a market cap of nearly $160bn that also puts the company in between the nominal GDPs of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For what it’s worth Tesla isn’t in the S&P 500 but a quick look at the index would mean it would be around the 50th largest and would have added roughly 13pts to the index this year. Incidentally, the electric car maker may soon be eligible to join the index now that it is close to posting four straight quarters of profits – the only requirement the company was short.
The more macro focus yesterday was the results of the Iowa caucus and following “inconsistencies in the reporting” we’ve finally had an update overnight. At the time of writing, 71% of the vote has been made official. Currently South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg is leading among delegates with 26.8%, followed closely by Senator Sanders with 25.2%, then Senator Warren with 18.4%, and Vice President Biden at 15.4%. This would be a very disappointing result for Biden, who came into the night polling in second place. Mayor Pete became the winning Moderate and while the results are not final, they stand to show the current break in the Democratic primary between the Left (Sanders + Warren = 43%) and the Moderate (Biden + Buttigieg + Klobuchar = 56) wings. Markets are not likely to react strongly to the democratic primary until you see the more Left candidates’ numbers climb higher.
Prior to this President Trump addressed the nation in his 2020 State of the Union, however there wasn’t a huge amount to report. Trump previewed his 2020 general election pitches; touting a strong economy on the back of deregulation, renewed trade deals, and lower corporate taxes, promising continued focus on immigration reforms, and pushing plans on health care changes. Staying with Trump, yesterday Gallup’s latest approval rating put the President at 49%, which is the most since he took office.
Back to markets and a quick glance at our screens this morning shows the positive momentum has continued into Asian markets with Chinese bourses leading the advance – the CSI (+1.13%), Shanghai Comp (+1.25%) and Shenzhen Comp (+2.63%). The Nikkei (+1.42%), Hang Seng (+0.47%) and Kospi (+0.58%) are also making gains. In FX, the Singaporean dollar is down -0.75% this morning as the country’s central bank said that it sees room for more easing. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are down -0.12% and Brent crude oil prices are up +1.30% overnight even as Saudi Arabia’s push for deeper output reductions to combat the drop in consumption received resistance by Russia. As for overnight data releases, China’s January Caixin services PMI came in at 51.8 (vs. 52.0 expected) bringing the composite to 51.9 (vs. 52.6 expected).
Looking ahead to today, whether the positive risk momentum continues may depend on the data. Of particular note are the ISM non-manufacturing and ADP employment change prints. The consensus expectation is for the headline in the former to tick up slightly to 55.1 however it’s the employment component which will also be watched closely given payrolls is due at the end of the week. Our economists have highlighted that this series was up a little over three points in December from its September low of 51.7. Thus, further improvement would be a positive sign given that the services sector accounts for nearly 84% of private payrolls. With respect to the ADP employment survey, it has missed the initial BLS prints over the past couple of months by fairly wide margins. Market participants may therefore want to discount somewhat its signal.
Back to yesterday where, in other markets, there was also a decent bounce back for European equities where the STOXX 600 rallied +1.64%. More interesting were some of the comments at a corporate level regarding the impact of the coronavirus. Oil giant BP suggested that one-third of global oil demand is under threat while Carlsberg mentioned that it’s breweries in China remain closed. Pandora also flagged the risk to its lucrative Asia business. Adding to these comments, one of the key Apple suppliers in China, Hon Hai, slashed its sales growth forecast range overnight to 1% - 3% (from 3% - 5% earlier). Walt Disney also said overnight that it expects the Shanghai park closure alone to reduce profits in the current quarter by $135m, assuming it is shuttered for two months, while the loss from closing of the Hong Kong park would likely add another $40m. In bond markets yesterday the risk-on sentiment saw yields move sharply higher. Indeed 10y Treasury yields backed up +7.2bps while 10y Bunds were +4.3bps higher. Brent and WTI oil retraced over 2% intraday gains to finish down -0.90% and -1.10% respectively as demand concerns mount while Gold edged down -1.31%. In credit, US HY spreads finished 11bps tighter.
In other news, yesterday’s data was mostly an afterthought in the US. The final core capex orders reading was revised up one-tenth to -0.8% mom while durable goods ex transport were unrevised at -0.1%. Meanwhile, factory orders were reported as rising +1.8% mom.
Finally, to the day ahead, where this morning the focus will be on the remaining PMIs in Europe with final January services and composite prints due. Away from that we’re due to get December retail sales for the Euro Area while in the US the PMIs are due along with the January ISM non-manufacturing, January ADP report and December trade balance. Elsewhere, the ECB’s Guindos, Perrazzelli, Lane and Lagarde are all due to speak – the latter in Paris at 12.15pm GMT, while the Fed’s Brainard speaks this evening albeit on payment innovation. As for earnings, Merck, Glaxo, Siemens and General Motors are among the highlights. "
IBM Business Partner Evanston Technology Partners & Cylera Announce New Solution to Help Hospitals Manage & Protect Ventilators & Other Critical Medical Devices in the Age of COVID-19. 	"IBM Business Partner Evanston Technology Partners and Cylera , recently partnered together to address new challenges facing hospitals, providing asset management and cybersecurity protection, through a newly formed joint Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) solution that provides healthcare delivery organizations a way to continuously manage, optimize, and secure critical medical devices, including ventilators and supporting healthcare assets such as IoT, operational technology (OT) and network connected devices. ""Hospitals and healthcare providers are rapidly adding new medical devices, ventilators, and the like, to their network at a frenetic pace, equipment at risk for cybersecurity compromise,"" said Emmanuel Jackson, Founder & CEO, Evanston Technology Partners (ETP), a certified, Minority Business Enterprise.
Healthcare delivery organizations globally have been challenged historically with the ever-increasing demand of connected medical devices that are in need of continuous management; add a global pandemic into the mix and the risk is exacerbated exponentially. As Ralph Ramsey, Global Associate Partner at IBM Security Services for Healthcare and Life Sciences, states ""the combination of cyber threats and lack of situational awareness has created the perfect storm atop of what will inevitably be a huge lesson learned for many healthcare organizations. Not only in managing the next crisis, but the role of enabling technologies that will be relied on in a variety of public health emergencies.""
A consequence of meeting the COVID-19 pandemic at such a rapid pace is that government officials and healthcare organizations are unable to balance demand, cybersecurity and the inventory management of all the new devices being added daily. ""This absolutely has an effect on saving lives given the shortage of life-saving equipment that must be deployed to the next hot-spot,"" Ramsey added.
""During a crisis, the private sector, cities, and states need to work together to get devices and resources to the areas of most need. It is critical to have a comprehensive management solution of network-connected devices that will assist healthcare organizations in tracking inventory, as well as allowing organizations to assess their device capabilities and security posture,"" said Tremayne Smith, Chief Information Security Officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. ""Being able to secure and easily share information from these systems, as we have learned to do with electronic health records, will allow us to support our communities and save lives, which should be the ultimate goal during an emergency response.""
These risks and consequences propelled leading hospital systems to approach Evanston Technology Partners to develop what today is being announced today as the Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) Solution.
ETP's Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC), powered by IBM and Cylera, will provide a comprehensive overview of the availability and security of network-connected healthcare assets and medical equipment, following the guidelines of the CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities. The HAOC will help healthcare providers effectively manage and maintain these critical medical devices and resources to prepare and respond to medical surge events, such as the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic.
""Healthcare organizations are challenged with enormous visibility and security gaps during the COVID-19 response given increased patient care needs, medical device requirements and the growth of targeted threat actors looking to take advantage of the current situation. Hospitals not only need actionable operational intelligence, but they also want the means to efficiently monitor their environment to the minute and dynamically respond to any changes,"" said Timur Ozekcin, Co-founder and CEO at Cylera. ""A unified solution provides the best of multiple approaches to solve a broad range of operational and cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.""
The HAOC solution is designed to safely and remotely provide hospitals real-time operational intelligence, inventory monitoring, and cybersecurity of critical medical devices and equipment which are of vital need during a public health emergency. These medical devices include ventilators, infusion pumps, imaging devices and laboratory equipment. The HAOC enables bidirectional situational awareness between public health agencies and healthcare providers to help identify and eliminate inefficiencies around unused or underutilized assets. Thus, allowing comprehensive management across distributed locations to securely facilitate effective preparedness and response while minimizing roadblocks to patient treatment.
The HAOC solution is available now.
Evanston Technology Partners has developed financing models with our partners to offer financing and delayed payments of 3 to 12 months.

Corona Corona. 	"The coronavirus seems to have been downplayed or shrugged off in this country for some reason, yet the WHO is now referring to it as a global crisis. I couldn't help thinking about what would happen if a terrorist somehow got a hold of this virus or Ebola, for example, and infected people at the Super Bowl or other large gathering. Better to blow it all out of proportion and be safe than minimize it and pay the consequences. If you want to see what's really happening, check out this coronavirus tracker from The Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It shows you the number of confirmed cases by country as well as the number of people who have recovered or died. Argus Hamilton has a quip for the occasion : ""China's government quarantined cities in Hunan Province where the Corona Virus is believed to have originated. The concern over its spread is escalating. An arriving Chinese citizen caused a wild stampede at L.A. Airport when he identified himself to Immigration officers as Ah Chu."" And Stephen Kruiser helps to debunk the moronic myth that this virus has something to do with Corona brand beer. "
Watch: Rakhi Sawant claims to have killed the corona virus after her visit to China on PM Narendra Modi’s request. 	"Watch: Rakhi Sawant claims to have killed the corona virus after her visit to China on PM Narendra Modi’s request Bollywood Hungama News Network By Bollywood Hungama News Network Created: Feb 5, 2020 - 4:13 pm IST
While the world is busy battling the coronavirus, controversy queen Rakhi Sawant has claimed that she went to China and killed the virus. Rakhi Sawant who shares bizarre videos on her Instagram handle has shared two new videos where she talks about going to China and killing the deadly virus.
In the first video posted two days ago, Rakhi Sawant can be seen sitting in an airplane. She is heard saying, “Friends, I am on a flight, I am going to China. This virus, coronavirus, to kill that and I've a lot of warriors with me.""
She adds, ""I am going to China, I will end the virus and no one will fall sick now."" Rakhi also claims to have ordered a 'special' medicine from NASA. The first video ends with Rakhi Sawant reaching China with the promise of killing the virus.

Today, Rakhi posted another video where she spoke about her trip to China and how she ended the virus. “Narendra Modi has sent me to China in his special chartered plane. The Prime Minister took me in confidence and told me that I am the only woman in the country who can kill the virus.”

She further said that there were people in the plane with her who were from the NASA, whom she termed as her ‘army’.
“I have been successful in defeating the virus. I have been to every house in China and sprayed the medicine given to me by NASA,” she claimed.
Rakhi further claimed that she came back from China after scaling the Great Wall of China as there were no flights coming back to India from there. ""You will see a stamp on my passport on my arrival in China, but not on my return,"" she added.
""I got some virus back with me in a box and have kept it safely. I will give it to the rape convicts in the Nirbhaya case as they are not being hanged."" She said that she will release the ""virus in Tihar jail"".
Meanwhile, in reality, the virus outbreak in China has claimed over 400 lives and over 20,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus. A cure for the virus is yet to be found. "
Slow Joe Wants to Import Corona Virus. 	"Slow Joe Wants to Import Corona Virus U nlike the feckless Obama regime which deliberately imported the Ebola virus, President Donald J. Trump has restricted the importation of a deadly virus, from Conservative Tree House :
In response to an escalating spread of the Coronavirus President Trump initiated a suspension of entry visa’s for persons traveling from China: “ The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the People’s Republic of China, excluding the Special Autonomous Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited ”
While waiting for some lame brain Ninth Circuit Court judge to issue a nation wide injunction against protecting the American public, Slow Joe Biden has shown that he rather pander to his Chinese puppet masters, than protect the country:
 “We have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus,” Biden said in Iowa Friday. “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.” .
Mrs. Pelosi and her gang either have to denounce Slow Joe or own the Corona Virus."

Siemens to Offer Laboratory-Based SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Test with Time to First Result of 14 Minutes - COVID-19 . 	Based SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Test with Time to First Result of 14 Minutes By HospiMedica International staff writers Posted on 24 Apr 2020 Image: Siemens’ Atellica Solution immunoassay analyzer (Photo courtesy of Siemens Healthineers) Siemens Healthineers (Erlangen, Germany) has developed a laboratory-based total antibody test to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood. The test, which detects both IgM and IgG, has demonstrated specificity and sensitivity of greater than 99%. The total antibody test will provide a clear view of a patient’s disease progression by identifying individuals infected with the virus who have developed an immune response to the virus, even if they were asymptomatic or never diagnosed with the disease. The test will add to Siemens’ robust diagnostics portfolio currently aiding in the prognosis, treatment and follow up of COVID-19 patients, such as its molecular Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) SARS-CoV-2 test kit. The test will be available on Siemens’ Atellica Solution immunoassay analyzer, which can run up to 440 tests per hour2 and will enable a result in just 14 minutes. In addition, the serology test also is expected to be available on the company’s expansive installed base of ADVIA Centaur XP and XPT analyzers, which deliver up to 240 tests per hour, with a result in 18 minutes. The availability of this test on these industry leading platforms will ensure more patients are tested in a shorter time. Siemens anticipates availability of the total antibody test by late May 2020. The planned expanded production in the company’s manufacturing facility in Massachusetts, USA will accommodate more than 25 million tests per month in June and beyond. The company is pursuing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the CE Mark. Comparable tests for Siemens Dimension Vista and Dimension EXL systems will also be pursued in the coming weeks to further expand clinical reach. In addition, the company intends to develop an IgG test to provide flexibility for testing needs as the pandemic evolves. “Siemens Healthineers is working diligently to address the need for high-quality tests in the fight against COVID-19. This test is being designed with the precision and controls, sensitivity and specificity that laboratories have come to expect from our immunoassay tests,” said Deepak Nath, PhD, President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers. “I am especially proud of the dedication of our colleagues involved in development of this test—many of whom are based at the epicenter of the pandemic.” 
Corona-virus Reminds Once Again: The Indispensable God-hypothesis. 	"Corona-virus Reminds Once Again: The Indispensable God-hypothesis Painting on the ceiling of Sistine Chapel in Rome by Michelangelo representing God the Father and Adam
Written and collected by Zia H Shah MD , Chief Editor of the Muslim Times This is an article describing the Transcendent, yet Personal God of the Abrahamic Faiths in the present day scientific paradigm, the One God of Islam, Unitarian Christianity and Judaism. If my articles are boring to you, it may be that you need to read more of them, as was suggested by John Cage, “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.”
In the three great monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism, God is viewed as a supreme, transcendent being, beyond matter space and time, and yet the foundation of all that meets our senses that is described in terms of matter, space, and time. That is the Al Batin or the Hidden God of monotheism. Furthermore, this God is not the god of deism, who created the world and then left it alone, or the god of pantheism, who is equated with all of existence. The Islamic and the Judeo-Christian God is a nanosecond-by-nanosecond participant in each event that takes place in every cubic nanometer of the universe. He has full knowledge of all things. God listens to every thought and participates in each action of his very special creation, a minute bit of organized matter called humanity that moves around on the surface of a tiny pebble in a vast universe. The Holy Quran declares:
Allah’s is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are all affairs returned for final judgment. (Al Quran 57:6)
Whereas the nineteenth century physics was about to frame God out of physical understanding of the universe, the twentieth century physics has turned the tables in favor of Monotheism.
To the atheists design in the universe is apparent but not real. For the theists, enlightened in science, the converse is true, the self sufficiency of the universe based on the laws of nature is apparent and perceived only and is not real. God is the Law Giver and sustainer of the universe. Both positions may be argued to some degree from modern science. However, only theism can offer a holistic approach, not only explaining our universe, but also human morality and ethics, our history and personal experience.
When we approach science from this theistic perspective we find that our religion and science become one and our psyche finds unification.
If there is a ‘Personal God’ that hears human prayers then there has to be a way for the deity to influence the physical world without breaking the laws of nature and making the study of science futile. Quantum physics may be the magical wand, whereby Personal God can influence our world, without breaking the laws of nature. In His infinite wisdom, the Omniscient God provided for infinite means to maintain His divinity!

 Corona virus emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and within a month, it spread profusely, infecting about three thousands people and killing 80.The plight of 110 million population of Wuhan is deplorable where hospital are teeming with patients and medical stores have run short of medicine,death is reigning and panic has gripped the entire area.People have stored food items and hidden in their homes.Apart from China, the Corona virus has crossed the boundaries and has entered in 20 countries.By each passing day, Corona fever is becoming pandemic and its fear is hanging like sword of Damocles over the entire global population.As there is no vaccine available to combat the Corona virus so there is Hobson's choice to keep away from it and this is only possible by knowing the details of Corona virus and precautionary measures.
 Corona fever is caused by a group of corona virus of f amily Coronaviridae.It cause disease in bird, mammals, and man. In human, corona virus causes respiratory infection often mild and rarely acute and lethal. Corona is a Latin word meaning crown, when virus is observed under electron microscope; a fringe of large bulbous surface projection create an image of royal crown. Corona-viruses were first discovered in 1960s in chicken and two type of virus in human; suffering from influenza. There are many types of viruses that have been identified so far ; For example, SARS.CoV in 2003; HCoV NL63 in 2004; HKU1 in 2005; MERS-CoV in 2012 and 2019 nCoV in 2019. Most causes respiratory track infection.
 In recent Corona virus crisis, a novel strain of Corona-virus 2019 nCoV was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Wuhan is a city with 110 million population. So far 25 death have been reported and 547 confirmed cases.National Health Commission daily report of 26th, Janauary says 2744 cases and 80 deaths. Wuhan virus has 70% genetic similarity with SARC-CoV. It is suspected that this virus originated from snakes or bat.Out of the first 41 people infected; two -third had link with Huanan Seafood whole sale market , which also sold live animals. It shoes that virus probably transmitted from animals. Other countries that have confirmed cases are: Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong , United States, Singapore, France, Nepal, Sri lanka, Cambodia,Australia, Malaysia, Canada,UK( WHO did not confirm it)
 Virus enter cell and virus particle is uncoated and RNA genome enter cytoplasm. Genome attaches to ribosome for translation. RNA genome make new copies using host cell machinery,thus increase in number. Its incubation period is for 2-14 days. There are two test to identity corona virus; first one is PCR Nucleic Acid Testing in which DNA of virus is detected. Second is ""crown morphology"" of corona virus is seen through Electron Microscope.The Minister of state for Health Zafar Mirza admitted that we have not enough facilities to identify and screen corona virus.So, we must be extra careful and should adopt measures to keep it at a bay.
 As far as ts treatment is concerned ,no vaccine is available so far . Suspected person is advised to wear mask. US CDC prescribed that patient should take flue medication, drink fluid and take rest.When its vaccine will come in market?This questions peeps in every mind. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) is hooping for human trial of medicine by April 2020. Chinese Centre of Disease Control and Prevention CCDC has started developing vaccine against noval Coronovirus. Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation ( CEPI) is funding three vaccine projects and hope to have a vaccine by jun 2020.So, at this stage, ""precaution"" is the best ""vaccine""..
 Its symptom includes;Fever, coughing, breathing difficulty,in sum, flu like manifestation.Precautions are the more viable and practical solution to keep safe.It incledes: Regular hand washing; covering mouth and nose as it is air born disease ( spread by air); avoid close contact with person showing respiratory illness as it is contagious disease( spread by touch); doctor should use bunny suit (protective clothing from head to toe); keep away from pet animals; cook food completely especially meat or eat fruit and vegetables; avoid touching eye,nose or face of anyone; put vicks or oil in nose and try to breath through nose;keep moistened throat; and avoid catching flue.
Another question that comes in mind is about its mortality rate? China say 4% patient dies; WHO say 25% get serious illness; and most of the neutral observers have calculated mortality rate of 10%.It means one out of ten kick the bucket and nine get well.
 There is a looming threat about its colossal damage.Dr Sallaudin Qadri said that any virus can become pandemic if four factors are available.If it is a new type of virus; it can be transmitted from animal to human; human body can develop a disease and virus can spread from human to human. Unfortunately, all four factor are there.So, the world community should fight it on war footing. Pakistan is said to have five cases; three(Chines) in Services Hospital Lahore and two in Nishtar Hospital Multan. But these cases are not officially confirmed.But it is imminent need of the time to first screen the people coming from china from all corridors; air port, sea port and land route. Second, a massive awareness campaign is to be launched in print,electronic media and social media.Third if there is any confirmed case, he should be kept in quarantine. But one fact should be kept in mind, it is winter season and one often gets flue but every person getting cold should not be labelled with Corona virus before proper investigation.As anxiety of disease worsen the malady many fold. There is formula in medicine; two and two is not four, it is twenty two.It means if one get sick and then get anxious about it, the disease will not be in tune of 4 but it will increase to 22 . Further there is maxim: 'cat has nine lives"" meaning it is difficult to kill a cat, being tough.But in another adage, it is said:"" care killed a cat"" . It shows how dangerous it is anxiety that it killed sturdy nine lives having cat.So avoiding worry and anxiety is also a ""treatment.""

Is the New corona virus disease x the visus that many people are saying is the virus that Will spell doomsday. 	Is the New corona virus disease x the visus that many people are saying is the virus that Will spell doomsday and the end of human life on earth? 2 Scroll Giggletr0n | 59 opinions shared on Trending & News topic. Guru 1 d Not even close. Last tests put it at the level of slightly weaker than the flu. Currently the death toll is 2% out of everyone infected and even then those dead people all had underlying conditions, were extremely young or extremely old. 
Wuhan’s Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) is airborne. 	"Adding to the woes that residents in China are already facing, health officials in ShangHai has announced that the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) that has wrecked havoc in China is “airborne”.
The new revelation means that other than the already known modes of infection, namely via droplets, fomites and faecal-oral transmission, the 2019-nCOV virus can now also spread via aerosol transmission*.
The startling revelation was made on Saturday (8 Feb) by ShangHai Civil Affairs Bureau deputy head Zeng Qun, who was Quote: d by state-owned China Daily .
Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts.
As such we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease.
With millions of residents returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, concerns about airborne spread of the 2019-nCOV virus are so dire that health authorities in China have further urged residents to avoid gatherings, open windows to help with ventilation, practice good personal hygiene and regularly disinfect their homes, especially areas like door handles, dinner tables and toilet seats.
Singapore: Do not wear a mask if you are well
On a related note, with this added mode of transmission for the deadly Novel Coronavirus revealed, maybe it is time for the health authorities in Singapore to consider revising its “Do not wear a mask if you are well” BS advisory?
The island city currently has 43 confirmed cases, 98 suspected cases and 892 close contacts who are being quarantined or isolated, while hundreds or maybe thousands of people on mandatory Leave Of Absence (LOA) are still roaming around freely.
What do you think?
Updated: MOH disputes aerosol transmission claim
In a press release, MOH said it has looked into reports that the novel coronavirus could be transmitted through aerosol.
MOH cited an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention who said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol."

Clover Initiates Development of Recombinant Subunit-Trimer Vaccine for Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 	"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, today announced that it has initiated development of a recombinant subunit vaccine for 2019-nCoV, the newly identified coronavirus that is believed to have originated from Wuhan, China.
Since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the 2019-nCov virus has so far infected thousands of people and has caused over one hundred reported deaths (as of January 28, 2020). The epidemic currently appears to be in an exponential phase.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Clover is using its patented Trimer-Tag © technology to construct a recombinant 2019-nCoV S protein subunit-trimer vaccine (S-Trimer) and will produce it via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Clover expects to obtain highly purified S-Trimer vaccine for further preclinical safety and analysis within the next 6-8 weeks. Having its own in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities, Clover would potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a coronavirus vaccine, if a successful vaccine candidate is able to be identified.
Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-trimer vaccines for HIV, RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.
“Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last week, we immediately started designing the vaccine construct and initiated its gene synthesis. Using our proprietary Trimer-Tag © protein trimerization technology, we plan to complete constructing the expression vector for S-Trimer vaccine and produce it for further evaluation within weeks,” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We believe that S-Trimer utilizing Trimer-Tag © technology will be faster to produce and potentially safer and more effective than vaccines produced via traditional approaches that involve lengthy live viral propagation, amplification, purification and heat/chemical attenuation or inactivation processes.”
“We are excited to initiate development of the S-Trimer vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV and hope that by leveraging our proprietary Trimer-Tag © technology and cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities, we can help support global efforts to fight the growing 2019-nCoV epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaboration will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful vaccine, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact and collaborate with us.”

Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.
About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
The new coronavirus identified in late-2019 was officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of the respiratory system. 2019-nCoV has never before been found in human and has infected thousands and caused over one hundred deaths (as of January 28, 2020). Currently there are no vaccines or safe and effective treatments available for the virus."
‘Wrong corona virus’. 	"A young Cape Town mother went into a panic yesterday when her nine-month-old daughter was diagnosed with corona virus.
But the hospital has assured the 29-year-old woman, who doesn’t want to be identified, that she skrikked vir niks as her baby girl is not suffering from the deadly strain of the virus which is causing panic in the world- China in particular- where more than a 100 people have already died.
The mom says her baby had displayed flu-like symptoms on Monday and they took her to their local GP who referred them to Melomed Tokai for further testing.
“I got the test results and it showed ‘Corona virus detected’ and this immediately made me think the worse because of everything we’ve seen in the media about the dangerous corona virus from China,” she says. DEADLY: Corona virus has killed more than 100 people in China
According to the results of the sputum test, the Corona virus NL63, as well as Human Rhinovirus and Influenza A (H1N1) were detected in the baby.
But this virus is different from the strain in China.
Corona viruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds and can be transferred to humans.
In humans, it causes respiratory infections, including the common cold, but rarer forms like SARS and MERS can be lethal.
The name “corona virus” is derived from the Latin word, meaning crown, and refers to the halo-like particles around the virus.
Seven human corona viruses have been identified to date: two in the 1960s, and five since the deadly SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003.
The latest one in China, which broke out in December 2019, is suspected to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan.
The mother says after reading that her child has corona virus, she panicked and tried to figure out how her baby could have caught it all the way from China.
“Doctors came to her bed (yesterday) and I just burst into tears thinking the worst, but the doctor explained that [pathologists] put corona virus on my results with a code which I did not understand.
“As a parent, you just see corona virus and don’t the knowledge and seeing her like this is heartbreaking. But she just has the flu.
“Doctors say that if she had the dangerous corona virus from China, she would have been in a separate room under quarantine, and she wouldn’t have been as calm as she is and we would have had to wear masks,” she says. OBSERVATION: Melomed in Tokai
Melomed Group Marketing Manager Shameema Adams confirmed the baby was admitted for observation.
“We would like to assure you that this strain of corona virus is not the one from China and is a normal seasonal flu virus which will be detected in children especially where there is also a case of H1N1.
“This has also been confirmed by Dr Maritz at the Virology department of PathCare.”"

Feds crack down on phony COVID-19 cures. 	"Fears surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus have spawned a rash of fraudulent cures involving dangerous behaviors like ingesting a powerful bleaching agent , or inhaling a toxic gas.
In Dallas on Friday, a federal judge granted a permanent injunction against Purity Health and Wellness Centers, a company that prosecutors allege solicited “ozone therapy,” which involves inhaling ozone gas, as a cure or method of preventing COVID-19.
“This defendant preyed on public fear, peddling bogus treatments that had absolutely no effect against COVID-19,” said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox in a statement. “As we’ve said in past COVID-19 civil cases : The Department of Justice will not permit anyone to exploit a pandemic for personal gain.”
According to the complaint the company marketed the treatment on its Instagram page and posted statements saying, “The CORONA VIRUS is here in the USA. The only prevention is ozone. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.” Another read, “Corona Virus update: ozone eradicates lethal viruses and bacteria. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.”
In a recorded phone call earlier this month, Jean Allen, the owner of Purity Health, told a prospective customer that there was a COVID-19- positive patient in the facility for treatment.
“When asked how Defendants would stop the transmission of the virus given that patient’s positive diagnosis, Defendants offered as the only protective measure the purported fact that ozone would sanitize everything,” court documents say.
At the time of publication, there was no attorney of record for Purity Health and Wellness Centers or Allen.
“Victims suffer financial losses from the wire fraud scheme facilitated by Defendants, and victims further suffer harm via potential exposure to COVID-19 by unnecessarily visiting Purity Health’s location for a treatment that does not work,” the complaint says.
Last week, prosecutors took similar action against a chiropractor who was advertising homeopathic remedies that would provide “up to 90 percent protection” against COVID-19. Ray Nannis was touting the products as an effective COVID vaccine and treatment produced by his company, Optimum Wellness Solutions.
“As I’ve mentioned before, we do have a homeopathy,” Nannis told viewers in an April 1 video posted to his company’s Facebook page.
“It works as, based on history of over 20 years, on dealing with viruses that are very similar,” he said. “It can help the body up to 90% deal with what’s going on with the body. What it does is it gives the body an immunological and a neurological recognition of the energy, of the frequency of a virus, and this specific one being the coronavirus.”
In a phone conversation with a U.S. Secret Service special agent, Nannis said that “if someone became infected with the novel Coronavirus and/or COVID-19, the homeopathy he was offering would minimize any associated symptoms.” He then offered to sell the product to the agent for $95 per dose and said he would ship it directly if the agent provided his credit card information, according to the complaint.
While Nannis said he could not call his product a “cure” because of FDA restrictions, he said that it nonetheless “basically” was one “for all intents and purposes,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. At this time, there are no products approved by the FDA that prevent or treat COVID-19.
The court granted the temporary restraining order against Nannis and Optimum Wellness Solutions, and ordered that he “immediately cease offering to treat, cure, prevent, or otherwise mitigate the impact of the novel Coronavirus or COVID-19, including, in particular, in connection with any ‘homeopathy’ or ‘homeoprophylactic.'”
Nannis’ lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Earlier Friday, President Trump sought to clarif y the comments he made at the Coronavirus task force briefing the day before, in which he mused about the possibility of a cure. “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,” the president said Thursday. “One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.”
Mr. Trump told CBS News’ Weijia Jiang in the Oval Office Friday that he “was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.”"
Pentagon approves quarantining Americans aginst their will on military bases amid Corona virus outbreak. 	"The Pentagon has approved quarantine camps, a.k.a. death camps, in the United States, to house American detainees suspected of being infected with the 2019-nCov Coronavirus or merely coming in contact with someone who was.
From MSN : Defense Secretary Mark Esper is expected to support the request for the locations, which would be used “should HHS facilities become filled.” The statement notes that the military facilities would house up to 20 people each “as they undergo a period of quarantined observation,” but would be third in line to place individuals as “HHS already has primary and secondary locations identified that are not DOD facilities.”
However, the camps are not limited to people who have traveled from overseas as most media outlets make it out to be.
One report from CBS Sacramento reveals how the military will be snatching and grabbing regular everyday citizens off the streets.
The real truth of the matter is that just like in China when the camps become full or overwhelmed many people in them start dying. In fact, the Chinese military had to build motes around the camps in an effort to detour detainees from escaping.
Keep in mind, wargaming such a scenario, one could simply be eating lunch at their favorite fast food place sometime in the near future when the military arrives and grabs everyone inside after an infected person was reported to have entered the establishment. Detainees would then be taken to a camp where if not infected already they will likely then become infected. Especially, being packed in with other sick and unruly people, anything could happen. A good example of this is how people have been quarantined on cruise ships where the virus just keeps spreading adding to the number of infections until nobody is left."

Vaxil Announces the Identification of a Potential Corona Virus Vaccine Provides an Update in the Previously Announced Debt FinancingNot for distribution by US newswire or in United States. 	"Vaxil BioTherapeutics (“ Vaxil ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX VENTURE: VXL), an innovative immunotherapy biotech company specializing in cancer and infectious diseases, is pleased to announce that it has completed in silico analyses and believes that it has successfully identified a corona virus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate (“ Vaccine Candidate ”). The Vaccine Candidate is based on unique and patent protected signal peptide technology, utilizing Vaxil’s proprietary VaxHit™ bioinformatics platform. The Vaccine Candidate’s design is also based on successful in vivo experiments testing a tuberculosis signal peptide vaccine.
“We are very excited to have been able to isolate a preliminary candidate that might address the current and emerging need in such a short time,” said David Goren, Vaxil’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who went on to say that “we look forward to the next step of identifying resources and partners to solidify the most efficient path forward.”
Mr. Goren continued to explain that “we have identified signal peptide combinations which we believe can be effective as a prophylactic vaccine against the current corona virus and might also demonstrate therapeutic value in the future.”
Vaxil plans to initiate non-GMP manufacturing followed by testing as we explore partnerships and other possibilities.
Vaxil also wishes to announce that it anticipates that the private placement previously announced on January 20, 2020, pursuant to which the Company will be issuing convertible debentures with a face value of $1,000 and bearing an annual interest rate of 10% for gross proceeds of up to $200,000 will close on or around February 28, 2020.
ABOUT VAXIL
Vaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin™ successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucin™ and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution. Additional indications and mAb candidates are under evaluation as immuno-oncology and infectious disease treatments alone and in combination with other treatments.
Vaxil exploits the unique properties of signal peptide domains on crucial proteins to develop targeted therapies against cancer targets and infectious disease pathogens. These signal peptide domains are identified by VaxHit™, Vaxil’s proprietary bioinformatic approach. These SPs induce a robust T- and B-cell response across wide and varied HLA subtypes, while acting as true, universal neoantigens. The peptide platform targets these cells by “educating” or specifically activating the immune system to recognize and attack the affected cells. In addition, Vaxil’s mAb platform directly recognizes the target protein expressed on malignant cells and recruits other elements of the immune system to lyse those cells.

Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.
In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped.
He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.
Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked."

UPDATE on Corona Flu Like Pneumonia Virus. 	"Senator Tom Cotton Shreds China's Official Virus Story, Warns Of ""Super Laboratory"" Proximity Authored by Jared Harris via WesternJournal.com, A United States senator is casting major doubt on the Chinese government’s official story on the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, instead hinting that a biosafety laboratory working with the deadliest pathogens in the world could be the true source. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas dismantled a claim from China’s communist regime Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals.“China claimed — for almost two months — that coronavirus had originated in a Wuhan seafood market,” Cotton wrote on Twitter. “That is not the case.” In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion. Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining China’s claim. ""Ten days ago, China reported less than 300 had the virus. The country’s latest update now numbers the infected at over 11,000. An additional 15,000 in China are suspected of having the virus, but a reported lack of test kits prevents the government from giving an accurate number. When the number of infected was still low, China instituted a wide-reaching quarantine, sealing over 40 million inside cities. Now, the world appears to be sealing China in. ""Russia, Nepal, Mongolia and North Korea have all closed their borders with China. Even more countries are refusing Chinese nationals, including an unprecedented announcement from the administration of President Donald Trump barring entry into America for foreign nationals who have traveled to China While the virus has been found in several countries around the world including America, all eyes are now on China as the outbreak there shows no signs of slowing. ""(zerohedge) Zerohedge was Suspended On Twitter (And this is what did it:) Coronavirus Contains ""HIV Insertions"", Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said. “I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.” Cotton appears to be referring to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the country’s foremost virus research facility. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, which is part of the institute, is located only 20 miles from the Wuhan wet market, the “official” source of the outbreak according to China. Snakes, bats and other animals were identified as possible originators for the coronavirus in early investigations. The rapid spread of the virus, which makes previous contagions like SARS and swine flu look benign by comparison, seems to lend weight to the theory that the novel coronavirus is a tailored bioweapon. Economic Impact is Unfortunately Extremely Dismal Guest Writer (supports Sen. Cotton’s assertions) Two days ago, a paper published in the Biorxiv.org journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with “key structural proteins” of HIV. The paper, entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,” concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” providing strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China.

coronavirus: Corona outbreak in China hits low cost garment market in rural Bengal,. 	"Corona Virus outbreak in China has started casting its dark shadow over sectors beyond the boundary of health domain. Low cost non branded garment trade in Bengal rural level is a major victim.
“As an immediate impact, retail level price has started shooting up with rapidly depleting inventory here. Even worse is uncertain long term impact in the supply side in China. We are highly worried as the trade has almost completely become dependent on them,” said Bijoy Saha, a wholesaler in Siliguri dealing with Chinese kid’s ware, caps, belts etc. Saha is one of around 25 main wholesalers in this small town in Darjeeling foothills in West Bengal. The second trade hub in state for these low cost items after Kolkata .
According to market insiders, to cater to near 1.5 crore rural people from 5 industrially backward districts around Siliguri, these wholesalers annually import items worth around Rs 250 crore. “Rest of Bengal is served by over 2000 wholesalers from Kolkata with much higher average import volume,” said Bimal Mandal, a trader in Siliguri market.
Without any concrete database, size of the trade in Bengal is estimated as of over 30,000 crore per annum. Experts consider this as a great support to huge chunk of Bengal populace with lower than state’s average per capita income of around Rs 35,000.
“Usually we fly to Guangzhou in south China. Make our choice from endless alternatives and stock there. Finalize deal for two to six months and come back. The stock keeps on coming as we pay phase wise. Highly buyer friendly policy helps us to roll seamlessly with just 15 days paid inventory. But cancellation or alteration of order is difficult in these highly cost optimized deals,” said Saha. .
“Now, despite near zero stock in hand we are in limbo on paying for next consignments. But as demand for post winter items have started rising fast, Indian product suppliers have increased their price by 20%,”
Clear enough, the deep scar of Corona outbreak is going to remain here for long even after the crisis is over there.

WUHAN VIRUS/Experts find how moderate 2019-nCoV infection ends with death. 	"Experts have blamed a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome called ""cytokine storm"" for killing some novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected patients who were not very sick in the early stage of infection but eventually died of multiple organ failure, according to Chinese media reports.
The epidemic, which started mid-December in Wuhan, in China's Hubei Province, had claimed more than 800 lives in China as of Feb. 8, including Li Wenliang (李文亮), a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak late last year but was silenced by the Chinese authorities.
While most victims have been middle-aged, elderly or suffering from chronic disease according to official Chinese data, Li's death, as well as that of a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong, drew media attention as the epidemic has attacked more than 37,000 people in 28 countries around the world.
According to Chinese media reports, Zhong Ming (鍾鳴), a physician at the department of critical care medicine of Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai, warned that in some novel coronavirus cases, patients who developed only moderate symptoms at the onset of the disease later fell seriously ill and died of multiple organ failure.
He termed the condition a ""storm of inflammations"" (Excerpt) Read more at focustaiwan.tw ..."

WILL THE CORONA VIRUS CAUSE A GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE? THE BDI SAYS YES!. 	"Under the category, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Along this line of thinking, I feel like it’s the Monday before Black Tuesday in 1929. I know that many of you have family members who think you are insane to suggest that your bank could fail and the economy could fail due to the spread of the Coronavirus.
My heart breaks for many of my fellow Americans who will never know what hit them. Despite several and multiple warnings coming from both this publication and dozens of others that the crash of the U.S. economy could come at any time, and the warning signs, but globally and domestically are already in place. However, the cognitive dissonance crowd will continue to go through life as if nothing is wrong. How can we be certain that bad days lie ahead?
The Baltic Dry Index In the light of the Coronavirus, which is spreading with no end in sight, more people are feeling compelled to ask the question, will the global economy fail? Some are predicting that the global economy, including the US economy will fail due to the introduction of new factors such as the Coronavirus. How will we be able to tell if this happening?
Before the introduction of the Coronavirus, the global economy was already in deep trouble. What people should know is that back in December of 2019, before the Coronavirus went active, the global economy was on the verge of collapse. How do we know? We know because of what the Baltic Dry Index was doing. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials, such as coal and steel. In short, the BDI is one of the best indicators on how the global economy is performing. The fact that the Baltic Dry Index focuses on raw materials is important because demand for raw materials provides a glimpse into the future. In short, the DBI tells economists and governmental leaders how the global economy is doing at a given point in time as well as provides a means to predict future economic trends much like the futures market.
Before the introduction of the Coronavirus, Chinese-American trade tensions had already been contributing to a plummeting BDI, which would indicate that the global economy is in trouble and certainly the American economy would follow suit. In December, analysts were already associating the relentless slide of the BDI with an end to front-loading, triggering by easing of US-China trade tensions due to the new trade agreement signed by both side. The two sides signed the phase-one trade deal, which had been doing the rounds since the beginning of the final quarter of 2019.
Before the trade deal was signed, the BDI had already plummeted by a staggering 78%!

CDC says Hawaii is at low risk for the Corona Virus. 	"A highly unusual step for the Centers for Disease Control–they’ll be screening three airports for symptoms of a mysterious new virus.
One thousand staffers are being sent to New York City’s JFK International, San Francisco International and LAX. Passengers arriving from Wuhan, China will be checked for symptoms of fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The screening at JFK starts tonight. So far two people in China have died from the new virus called the Corona Virus. Some 45 others are infected.
The last time the CDC did routine passenger health screenings was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
The CDC and Hawaii Department of Transportation said that Hawaii wasn’t chosen for special screening because the threat for the state is very low.The center for disease control said there is no need to be alarmed and they want to reassure the public that they always screen international passengers for illnesses.
“They consider it low level of alert. But it is still something that’s being watched,” Doctor James Ireland said. Ireland is the medical director at the DOT.
Ireland said that the CDC continually monitors all international and domestics travelers. He added that Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is one of only 20 airports in the United states that the CDC monitors constantly.
“The airport has had a robust surveillance system. It’s been in place for over 10 years because of diseases like SARS and Avian influenza. It’s a team approach. The CDC oversees international travelers–they are the lead agency. They work with the state DOT. We have firefighters here at all the airports as first responders,” Ireland said.
Passengers who look sick or show symptoms of illness can be held in quarantine by the CDC.
“The fact that this is an international illness, outside the US, actually makes it easier because people have to come through customs and border protection and are screen to in general,” Ireland explained.
Travelers from Wuhan, China would automatically be taken aside and screened.
Spokesperson for the Department of Transportation Tim Sakahara said that unlike New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles there are no direct flights from Wuhan China to Honolulu or any airport in Hawaii.
Ireland said there is still much to learn about the virus.
“It’s not completely benign but it’s not as dangerous as I think some of the other similar viruses we’ve seen in the past are. But I wouldn’t really want to speculate,” Ireland said.
The CDC is continuing to monitor the situation and if anything changes they said they will inform the public. "
Lesson Learned – The Corona Virus. 	"Last week we talked about the most important thing to master – your emotions.
This week’s lesson is…
Never be forced to act.
About 15 years ago we were on the floor of the NYSE trading gold stocks. There was a CEO of a South African mining company who had gotten a bit out over his skis when it came to risk. His bankers were now demanding that he pony up more capital. Word got around the street that this chap was in dire straits and he had to offer 5 million shares of a rival gold company that he owned in order to raise capital. In the meantime, the price of the mining company had been driven down by short sellers who knew his situation. He was now forced to sell at an artificially low price. We were the lucky buyers that day as we bought 20% of his stake. Suffice to say that we were very happy over the next several weeks as the stake that he was forced to sell us tripled in price.
The mining CEO had over leveraged himself and was forced to sell at the lows. There are all kinds of ways we can get forced into action when investing. We never want to be forced into action. Chinese investors learned that lesson last week.
After the Lunar New Year Chinese authorities shut down access to markets for ten days due to the corona virus. When markets did reopen most stocks were Limit Down. Limit down means that, for all intents and purposes only buy orders are accepted. You cannot sell below the prescribed limit down. What happens if you really need the money? You have to wait until the next trading day and hope they are not limit down again. The further the price falls the more shares you, and everyone else, will need to sell. One thing we learned in the GFC of 2008 – anything is possible. Think the unthinkable. Markets could stay closed for days. ETF’s could fall below the price of their value as sellers overwhelm buyers in search of liquidity. China’s lesson is our lesson.
Markets are not efficient. They do not seek price equilibrium. Markets seek extremes. Markets are like teenagers. They will seek the limits to which they can push. Market regulators seek to decrease volatility. Decreasing volatility only increases the chances of a Minsky Moment as markets, seeing little risk, push the outer limits. Much like a controlled burn helps limit forest fires moves lower in asset prices create a respect for risk. We haven’t had a controlled burn in some time. Markets are pushing limits thanks to central bank policy from China to the US. This year’s action in Tesla is one clue. Tesla is up 78% YTD! Tesla is now worth more than Ford Motor, General Motors and BMW COMBINED!
Bonds and gold are still outperforming the S&P 500 YTD. We are watching copper and the debt markets. Copper is the global economic barometer and traded lower for 13 straight trading days. It has bounced off of its lows but it indicates that there is a serious slowdown in the world economy. The corona virus is having an impact on global GDP. Supply chains are being disrupted. If this goes on through next week companies will begin to report problems. The market may very well ignore it as a onetime problem but debts need to be paid and there is a large amount of debt needing to be rolled over in the next 24 months. Companies have taken on debt and used it buy back corporate stock. They may have painted themselves into a corner. Never be forced to do something. The corona virus may be what they didn’t see coming.
I think we aspire less to foresee the future and more to be a great contingency planner… you can respond very fast to what’s happening because you thought through all the possibilities, – Lloyd Blankfein
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. – Winston Churchill

"The Corona Virus Hysteria: Even More Proof That The Entire ""World Wide Epidemic"" Was A Scam!. "	"As I have shown in so many previous articles, the so called 'Coronavirus"" was indeed REAL, BUT it was never going to be this world wide ""epidemic"" as the criminals had originally wanted... In spite of the Jew spew media climbing on board the ""sky is going to fall"" bandwagon, the actual deaths associated with this virus has been minuscule in comparison to those who die from the annual Influenze outbreak Yes, people are indeed extremely gullible it seems for falling for all the hype...
Well, I came across the following report, from a fellow real truth seeker ""Aangirfan"" who writes his/her reports over at www.aanirfan.blogspot.com, and it absolutely shows how the entire ""pandemic"" fears being propagated by the liars in the Jew spew media are complete bullshit...Here in fact is Aangirfan's article, entitled: ""Coronavirus"" right here for all to see for themselves, and I do have my own thoughts and comments to follow:

CORONAVIRUS
Above, in the UK, we see people suspected of maybe having the coronavirus being taken on coaches to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral near Liverpool.
On the coaches, the specialists are wearing hazmat suits but the bus drivers are not wearing hazmat suits.
Coronavirus UK: Brit bus driver completely unfazed next to man in hazmat suit.
Jane Godman, from the Wirral, wrote on Twitter, 'Decision to have a coronavirus quarantine centre at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral is bizarre.
'One of the busiest hospitals in the North West, with a maternity unit, in a built up area, 170 miles from where the Wuhan plane lands. Who decided this and why?'

NTS Notes: The first picture alone in Aangirfan's article is PRICELESS...
NTS Notes: Yes, readers, here we have the public believing that people carrying the 'Coronavirus 2019-nCoV"" so called ""deadly"" virus are being bussed to a facility where they are to be quarantined, and that picture shows a person with a full blown Hazmat suit on, while the BUS DRIVER is wearing nothing at all to protect him from the 'virus'.... That alone shows that someone who wanted the propaganda that this virus was 'deadly' to be pushed into the minds of gullible people blew it big time..
And we have the same in that ludicrous picture from supposedly Dallas Fort Worth International Airport back in 2014 in that fraudulent ""Ebola Virus"" scare, with everyone is wearing a ""hazmat"" suit as well, but they again blew it by leaving one person with the clipboard WITHOUT a suit to be seen! Again, that clearly shows that event was so staged and so phoney!
Aangirfan does present some interesting information indeed, and once again he/she takes a swipe at that ludicrous ""Novichok"" scare in the UK from 2018 that was 100% a scam that the British people sadly fell for.... Sadly, to this day, the British people still think that actually did happen as the liars in their own government continue to promote!
The facts are that the liars in the Jew spew media and those involved to sell the world into the false belief that this 'coronavirus' is 'deadly' have failed miserably.... BUT as I have said many times, these liars and criminals know that the general public is so easily manipulated and that they could throw anything out there and gullible people will fall for the lies each and every time..."
Tijuana Runs Low On Ventilators As COVID-19 Cases Continue To Rise. 	"Tijuana Runs Low On Ventilators As COVID -19 Cases Continue To Rise. A medical professional sprays disinfectant into the air while transporting a patient in Tijuana in a photo provided anonymously to KPBS in April 2020.
In March, the Mexican government insisted that Mexico would be spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic because of its to its early implementation of social distancing.
But as the weeks passed, and California’s own curve flattened, the situation in Tijuana has become dire and deadlier than the situation in San Diego.
As of Friday, 110 people have died in Tijuana. Across the state of Baja California, 163 people are now dead from the virus. Yesterday was the deadliest day in Baja, 37 people died. The number of infected continues to rise, with 1,161 confirmed coronavirus cases in Baja California. The city of Ensenada is now on almost total lockdown. COVID-19 in Baja California
One huge problem facing Baja California? The lack of ventilators. There are currently just 10 ventilators still available in Tijuana.
A hospital worker in Tijuana sent KPBS a note describing conditions at Clinica Veinte, which has seen a huge influx of COVID-19 patients and is now building a tent to handle the overflow. She says officials are being very secretive about the true number of patients, and that she’s sure people have died while waiting for ventilators.
Tijuana is a huge producer of ventilators and other medical equipment, but much of that equipment is sent abroad, leading to conflict between Baja California Gov. Jaime Bonilla and its international trade partners. Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames. 

Under global trade law, Mexico is prohibited from buying many of the products it makes before they’re shipped abroad.
That has changed somewhat in recent days, after Bonilla threatened to shut down factories that weren’t contributing somewhat to Mexican efforts to handle the virus.
But with Mexican factories along the border playing a central part in the global supply chain, and workers there continuing to fall ill during the pandemic, every day Mexico’s factories remain open and without necessary safety precautions, is another day that the pandemic worsens in the country.
Doctors there, many already sickened, fear that the situation, already critical, will soon overwhelm the country’s hollowed-out health care system."
Corona-virus is Here. 	FREE & For Sale Corona-virus will sweep the globe eventually and there is no way to stop it. We should try to develop treatments but that is very difficult to do quickly enough to make a difference for its victims. Most humans live in an interconnected mono-culture pool of potential victims that is linked by air travel and other forms of global travel. Any type of new deadly disease has the potential to spread inside a human group of this type before travel restrictions can be imposed. This will probably not be the last deadly disease to successfully attack human, animal and plant genetic groups that are not physically separated. Photo by Pixabay on Pexels.com Our food supply of plant and animal products is just as vulnerable as humans are to new types of diseases because large sections of our food supply are mono-culture in nature. Modern man is not immune to starvation or economic upheaval as a result of crop diseases such as occurred during the Irish potato famine. It is even possible that some countries would genetically engineer specific diseases because of their belief systems. We should try to keep our farms genetically diversified to avoid a sweeping disease that would spread easily through a mono-culture such as corn. I detailed some ideas on how to maintain diversified farms in my book “The Family Farm Crisis Solution” because I think its a good idea to be prepared to deal with several unthinkable scenarios and to help maintain the family farm at the same time. Disaster mitigation is only about 30 percent of the book but it is part of it. The current corona-virus situation is a terrible human tragedy and I have great sympathy for its victims. I have a weakened immune system due to disease so it is highly possible that I may contract some form of this disease eventually and that it could make me very ill or kill me. I know someone with family in China that are in the process of fleeing that country and I hope they get home safely. I think that humans are directly tied to their food supply related diseases and that we need to find ways of mitigating these types of tragic disease outbreaks before they occur again.

Regarding the Corona-Virus.. 	"Gonna say this dude is not an expert.
Actual facts from actual experts-
the Corona Virus is transmissible before symptoms show
the Corona Virus takes ten days to show symptoms
You absolutely shouldn’t be shaking in terror, but you should also be properly informed so you can protect yourself. Disease, as always, will predominantly kill those who are young or old, or otherwise immunocompromised. Basic cleanliness will significantly cut down rate of infection, and is more important than either in times like these, and is the most important tool if you’re afraid.
Fear isn’t countered by saying don’t be afraid, stupid, it’s countered by knowing the actual risks and what can be done about it, not saying it’s not real it can’t hurt you."

First case of corona virus confirmed in Malaysia. 	"The corona virus, which spread around the world after its emergence in Wuhan, China, also emerged in Malaysia.
In the country with a total of 10 cases, the first case of corona virus has been approved.
The 41-year-old Malaysian patient traveled to Singapore to meet business partners from Wuhan, China, according to a statement by Malaysian health officials, began showing symptoms 1 week after returning to the country.
Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad stated that the corona virus was detected in the patient as a result of the examinations, while a 63-year-old patient from Wuhan, who showed similar symptoms, was also under surveillance.
"
A cure has been found for Corona Virus-China.. 	"A cure has been found for Corona Virus-China.
The Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. Zhou Pingjian, says a cure have been found for corona virus.
While addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, Pingjian said Chinese scientists were working to develop a vaccine for the virus, assuring that the epidemic would lose its momentum in the next two weeks.
According to him; ""All things considered, the epidemic can be contained, controlled and treated. The Chinese nation has gone through great winds and waves and overcome countless difficulties.
The 1000 bed marketshift hospital in Wuhan, which was built in 9-days, is in full operation today."
Thai Doctors Claim a Chinese Corona Virus Breakthrough. 	"WHO can only report the data given them. They do not perform independent data gathering. If the Chinese (or anyone else) fudge the inputs, then the WHO reports are so much confetti. 
To be serious in this reply, I live and work in Beijing and have a close coworker from Wuhan.
The Chinese numbers are badly understated, but could be as real as they can be- because it is impossible for them to be real. The govt is only providing a limited number of test kits to Wuhan on a daily basis (2000, I think the number is) for a city of 11 million, and people won’t go anywhere near a hospital until pneumonia has begun to develop or a neighbor has turned them in to the police because they heard a cough through the wall and the person was forced to go. (Videos online)
Some cities have barricaded people into their houses via piping used to hold the doors closed (doors here in China almost always open outward making that possible), literally trapping suspected sufferers in their house until they beg the police to escort them to a hospital just so they can get out. (Videos online)
But probably 90% of people won’t develop symptoms worse than a flu and recover without ever going to a hospital. The ones who succcumb appear to be those with issues causing mitochondrial problems- the elderly, diabetics, and genetic disorders. Children have not been dying or even getting seriously sick that anyone I know is aware of, and I am tapped into hospitals here in Beijing.
If I had to guess, I would lean towards claims that 75000 are infected is probably a low ball. 200,000 is probably closer to the mark as of the time I am writing this but most of them will never know it because almost no one ia going to be proactive about getting tested, and almost all of them will get better- the death rate for all countries not China is currently at 1%, so I think the 2% death rate being admitted to in China based on confirmed cases probably isn’t off by all that much, and even with officials putting thumbs on the scales I doubt it would exceed 4% if the numbers were honest.
Much lower than SARS or MERS. And in absolute numbers, the bog standard flu is going to kill far more people this season.
On a lighter note, traffic in Beijing is the best it has been in over 20 years. "
New York says none of its homeless tested positive for COVID-19, but those figures likely don't tell whole story. 	"Peter Tobin said he's been homeless, on and off the streets of New York City, for the last six months.
""It's pretty difficult because a lot of people are sick,"" he said. ""With the corona stuff going on, everything is sort of, like, delayed. It takes a lot longer of a process than normal to get services to, you know, get off the street and into an apartment.""
If the statistics from New York City are to be believed, the city's street homeless population is doing extraordinarily well in warding off coronavirus infections. That's despite living in unsanitary conditions with no regular access to disinfectants, masks and gloves — let alone a warm bed in which to sleep.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeless Services said they've only had to refer a dozen homeless individuals to get medical care for COVID-19.
""As of April 22, DHS outreach teams have conducted more than 16,000 engagements on the topic of COVID-19, including surveying clients in each of those engagements regarding whether they are feeling any symptoms,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""As a result, those outreach teams have made 12 referrals to care.""
""At this time, these referrals have not resulted in any positive cases.""
That's right — not one recorded COVID-19 case among the city's entire street homeless population typically totals between three and four thousand people. It's likely higher when considering the people who refuse to be counted.
""I don't need no help. I'm homeless,"" said homeless New Yorker Troy Walker.
Despite the city's count, it may never be clear just how bad COVID-19 is affecting New York City's street homeless population."
Hit Body With Powerful Light, Donald Trump's COVID-19 Cure Theory Is Viral . 	"Coronavirus: Donald Trump speaks during daily briefing on COVID-19 (AFP)
New Delhi:
An observation by a top US official that the coronavirus is quickly destroyed by sunlight led President Donald Trump to suggest a method to fight COVID-19 – injecting patients with disinfectants.
It took no time for President Trump’s comments at the White House briefing to spread on social media, with scientists and researchers criticising him.
William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary, told reporters at the White House that US government scientists had found ultraviolet rays had a potent impact on the pathogen, offering hope that its spread may ease over the summer. “Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air,” he said.
After Mr Bryan was done speaking, President Trump said he wondered whether the body could be cleansed with a “very powerful light”.
“So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous – whether it’s ultraviolet or just a very powerful light – and I think you said that hasn’t been checked because of the testing,” President Trump said.
“And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you’re going to test that, too, sounds interesting,” he said. The White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx was also in attendance. People tweeted videos of her surprised expression when President Trump was speaking.
“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that… It sounds interesting to me,” President Trump said, without explaining the type of disinfectant he was talking about.
It has long been known that ultraviolet light has a sterilizing effect, because the radiation damages the virus’s genetic material and their ability to replicate.
William Bryan shared a slide summarizing major findings of the experiment that was carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Centre in Maryland. It showed that the virus’s half-life — the time taken for it to reduce to half its amount — was 18 hours when the temperature was 21 to 24 degree Celsius with 20 per cent humidity on a non-porous surface. This includes things like door handles and stainless steel.
But the half-life dropped to six hours when humidity rose to 80 per cent — and to just two minutes when sunlight was added to the equation.
But the experiment’s paper has not yet been released for review, making it difficult for independent experts to comment on how robust its methodology was.

They are almost universally heathen and so it is only natural that the Lord would get angry occasionally and send something wicked among them. The Mongols, the English and Chairman Mao have all been instruments of His wrath. Now God has sent a new virus among the Chinamen and they are all going to die. It is called a Corona Virus and is apparently named after a popular Mexican beer. I believe it is no coincidence that this virus has a Mexican connection and is visited on China while they are treating President Brother Donald Trump so rudely in trade negotiations. Mexico is another country President Trump is having to deal with. The connection is undeniable.

He's had it for a month or more and no doubt left a trail of death and destruction in his wake, but no one noticed his wake of destruction among all the other wakes of destruction in Mexico. This is a serious matter. God has intended this virus to scourge the Chinamen and He does not want Chinese diseases to invade America. It could be His way of letting us know He is sick and tired of our backsliding ways and intends that we finally do something about Mexico. Over the years they have gotten closer and closer and now they are right across a little river from us. The time for talk is over! I propose an immediate airstrike on Reynosa and the surrounding area. Others more skilled at bombing can decide what armaments to drop on those people, but they need to be bombed today.

On next COVID-19 front line, New York nurse tends to discharged patients at home. 	"On next COVID-19 front line, New York nurse tends to discharged patients at home.
Home care nurse Flora Ajayi poses for a portrait after visiting a client during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., April 22, 2020. Nurse Flora Ajayi parks her car on a residential block in Queens, New York and pops open the trunk, revealing plastic bins full of personal protective gear. She dons gloves, a blue gown, two masks, a face shield and shoe covers and turns to enter the home of one of her COVID-19 patients.
Ajayi, 47, works alone on the next front line of the coronavirus pandemic. She is part of a network of New York home care nurses treating hundreds of patients who have been discharged from hospitals and sent home to recover from the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The highly infectious disease has killed at least 20,300 people in the state, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, where more people have died than any other country - at least 49,000, according to a Reuters tally.
Home care nurses have a vital role to play as patients transition from around-the-clock care in a hospital to life at home. Ajayi enters and exits virus-ridden homes daily, donning and doffing her protective equipment up to 12 times a day on curbsides around the city.
She cannot re-use the protective gear from home to home, so she keeps her car loaded with masks, gowns and gloves.
""We are also on the frontlines,"" Ajayi said of home care nurses, tying her gown behind her back as she prepared to enter the home of a 74-year-old woman who was recently discharged from a hospital stay with the coronavirus. ""The doctors want us to be the eyes and ears.""
As of April 22, 40,303 COVID-19 patients had been discharged from hospitals in New York, said the state's health department spokesman Jonah Bruno.
Clutching a bottle of hand sanitizer and with her loose blue gown flapping in the wind, Ajayi climbed the porch steps and rang the bell to a door with a bunny-shaped sign that read “Happy Easter!”
The patient’s husband, wearing a surgical mask, opened the door, greeted Ajayi with a friendly wave and stayed a couple feet back as he beckoned her inside.
It was the first time Ajayi had seen this patient since she had left the hospital. The patient’s cough was noticeably better than it had been on the phone days earlier, when Ajayi said the patient could not finish a sentence without coughing.
Ajayi conducts telehealth appointments with her discharged COVID-19 patients until they report no symptoms for three days, to reduce the risk of getting infected herself.
Still, Ajayi worries she might bring the virus back from a patient’s home to her own, where she lives with her son, 23, and her sister. She wears a mask at home and tries to stay 6 feet away from her family to limit any infection - a sacrifice she makes for the job she loves.
""I love to be part of the healing, part of the mentorship, part of the progression,"" she said. ""It makes it all worth it.""
'WE DON'T KNOW'
Ajayi works for Northwell Health, New York's largest healthcare provider with 23 hospitals.
Almost all hospitalized COVID-19 patients will require some medical follow-up or rehabilitation when they are discharged before they can regain their former quality of life, if that ever happens, said Dr. Maria Carney, Northwell's medical director for post-acute services.
""We’re really entering an area of 'we don’t know.' We don’t know what patients need right now, we just see that they are extremely weak, both physically and mentally,"" Carney said. ""How can our health system deal with that next phase of recovery? It’s going to be a challenge.""
Of the patients who have been discharged so far, many suffer from blood clots in their legs, muscle atrophy, aches, fatigue, cardiac issues and continued respiratory distress.
Patients who were intubated are showing these symptoms more acutely when discharged, and many also are showing cognitive impairment, which could be an effect of long-term sedation or a condition called Post-Intensive Care Syndrome, Carney said.
As the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from Northwell's hospitals topped 6,600 this week, the hospital system is considering hiring more home care nurses. It may also expand telehealth services and partner with local skilled care facilities to accommodate the discharged patients, Carney said.
Inside the homes, Ajayi answers a flood of questions from patients and their families, ranging from how often they should go to the grocery store to how they can self-monitor blood pressure.
She listens to the patients’ lungs with a stethoscope for signs of fluid build-up. She reminds them to not share toiletries and to wipe down doorknobs and light switches.
She checks the refrigerator and sometimes nudges them to call charitable meal delivery services if it is empty. She tells the doctor a patient needs more oxygen if she sees they are sleeping propped up in a chair, unable to breathe while lying flat.
Ajayi's five confirmed COVID-19 patients have made slow and steady progress since returning home, and none have needed to be readmitted to hospital.
Ajayi never removes her two masks and face shield around patients, but the creases around her silver eye-shadowed eyes give away her smile and her even voice brings comfort.
""We keep the calm in this hysteria for them,"" Ajayi said. ""They’re scared, we’re scared, but we can do it.""

Corona virus is a decoy. 	"So, the virus?
A decoy! Put in place to mask rescue missions of those ‘under the thumb!’
‘Under the thumb’ meaning being controlled or dominated by someone. So, to speak as it is … you are saying the virus was put in place to take the attention away from those of darkness who are about to be ‘caught.’
Correct, Blossom.
Yet, nonetheless the virus is a real thing that is killing people!
As with many viruses that have been concocted to cause great alarm and fear, there will always be ‘some medical situation’ that is made prominent at a time suitable for undercover agents to slip through the bar and slip away unseen.
So much that is presented in your world is that of a decoy nature. So much!
Then the fear that builds, feeds itself until this particular threat ‘dies down’ and those who created it sit happily in the knowing that once again their mission was successful.
Most of you who are aware KNOW all this."
Miracle in China. Infected Mom Gives Birth to Corona-Free Baby Girl. 	"Media in China have revealed the miracle of a girl who was born with full health from a mother who is infected with coronavirus .
The Chinese newspaper “China Daily”said that the case happened in a hospital in the city of Harbin in northeast China.
The baby was born last Thursday,weighing 3.5 kg,and is in good health.
But the surprise is that the two tests conducted for the girl,who was born after 38 weeks of pregnancy,have proven that her body is clear from the infection,which has already killed more than 360 people in China so far.
After days in quarantine,medical sources confirmed that the mother’s condition is stable. The China Daily newspaper said that the medical team,which was involved in following up the mother and child’s condition and performing the entire surgery,is currently carrying out medical observation.
China announced today that the death toll of the viral respiratory disease has risen to 361,out of more than 17,0 infected with the disease,as the virus has spread to 24 countries.
The Chinese government imposed strict restrictions in the central city of Wuhan,where the disease had spread,and tightened quarantine measures so that only one family member was allowed to leave to buy their food needs.
The Chinese military medical teams continued to arrive in Wuhan to relieve the health burden in the city,while several countries evacuated their nationals from the city.
Earlier,scientists at the Institute of Pharmacology in Shanghai affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their colleagues at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan affirmed that a herbal drug may fight the Coronavirus.
The drug is known as Shuang Huang Lian Koufuye;it is derived from local herbs used in Chinese popular medicine."
In suburban Atlanta, how one city's Main Street navigates COVID-19. 	"Matt Kempner , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Lost sales and worries about safety, but also some green shoots
For the small businesses ringing Main Street in one of metro Atlanta’s tiny downtowns, the last several weeks have been a test of will.
Scott Mecredy panicked that the pandemic could shutter his Music On Main Street, or MOMS, launched with money his mother gave him in her dying days. Nikki Fields Scott wondered how she’d pay both her mortgage and rent on Old Town Flowers & Gifts. Jonathan Hillyard agonized over which of his four employees, including a brother and niece, he would furlough first if his video production company, Connext Media, didn’t get more orders soon.

Lilburn’s commercial core is a microcosm of how the coronavirus is pummeling Main Streets around the nation, threatening to flatten businesses and reverse years of downtown revitalization efforts. An antique shop, sports training academy, martial arts studio, special events space, hair salon and Mexican restaurant closed temporarily in Lilburn, where 10 of 11 small business owners interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the pandemic has cut their revenue. Gwinnett County small business owners in downtown Lilburn are wrestling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. MATT KEMPNER / AJC
But the Gwinnett County community of nearly 13,000 residents is also a petri dish of experiments — some successful — as entrepreneurs try to keep their businesses breathing until more customers venture out again. Like the local distillery that switched to making hand sanitizer. Or the farm-to-table restaurant that started selling toilet paper, yeast and bleach. Or the business that, after awful worries, has seen sales surge.
Gov. Brian Kemp is moving aggressively to reopen Georgia’s economy. Everything from hair salons and gyms to bowling alleys and tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen Friday after being ordered shuttered in early April. On Monday, restaurants can reopen dining rooms and movie theaters can resume screenings. And a statewide “shelter in space” order for residents is set to expire after Thursday.
It’s too early to tell when the state’s Main Streets will fill up again, or if it will be quick enough that some businesses don’t shutter for good. Public health experts are still cautioning Georgians to avoid close human contact. Businesses that are open must maintain safety measures.
“One thing I’ve become absolutely convinced of during this pandemic is that I don’t know what is going to happen,” said Betsey Dahlberg, who owns Hope Springs Distillery with her husband and has had to reinvent the business on the fly.

Mother’s Day flowers, short on rent, cramped salon
For years, Lilburn’s central core lagged other metro Atlanta suburban cities that rebuilt downtowns for a walkable mix of restaurants, quaint shops and homes.
More recently, things were looking up. Downtown shop spaces were rented out. The adjacent city park and greenway attracted crowds for Food Truck Tuesdays and free summer concerts.
In recent weeks, crews razed the former municipal court building and police station, making room for a possible play fountain, public gathering space and maybe restaurant. The first of more than 50 planned homes are under construction across the street at the Old Town Lilburn project, including plans for a coffee shop and another restaurant. A development for independent older adults is being built nearby. A new development is underway in downtown Lilburn, but pandemic concerns continue to swirl in Lilburn and around metro Atlanta. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
The pandemic upturned everything. Events were postponed. Crews fenced off the playground at the city park. Few people strolled by shuttered shops.
Electrician Allan Cofer, whose family started in the same shop 56 years ago, saw a sudden dip in jobs. Three doors down, insurance agent Dan White said late payments on policies jumped 20%. Contractor Doug Mauk fretted after several construction projects were postponed, some indefinitely.
At Old Town Flowers, Scott said she was forced by a city emergency order to close her shop for two weeks, including during the crucial Easter holidays. Restrictions have since loosened but the 62-year-old owner, who learned the business working in her mom’s flower shop, now makes only deliveries. Nikki Fields Scott, at her Old Town Flowers & Gifts, isn’t ready to reopen the downtown Lilburn store to the public. But she is making deliveries. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
She thinks it’s too early to reopen the store, concerned about the virus. She pours a bit of bleach in water for her flowers, hoping that will reduce the risk. She wears a mask and gloves and leaves the flowers outside customers’ doors.
Scott’s sales were cut in half in recent weeks as people worried about money and pandemic restrictions slowed demand for flowers at funerals and for people at hospitals and nursing homes. She worries about what will happen next month for Mother’s Day, normally her second busiest time after Valentine’s Day.
Her landlord told her to just pay what rent she can for now. Scott said she paid half what she owed.
“God blessed me all through the years,” she said. “Even through this he still blesses me, because I am getting orders.”
Lilburn has offered deferment of some business taxes, and the Downtown Development Authority excused rent for store owners leasing public property.
Hugh Wilkerson, whose wife Rowann owns Antiques in Old Town, helps manage nearby shopping space for another property owner. Four of the five shops there didn’t fully pay last month’s rent, he said, because they had closed during the pandemic.
The couple live above their 26-year-old shop on Main Street, in a building that is more than a century old. The shop and its narrow, overflowing aisles closed for more than a month. The couple expect it to survive. Still, “there’s a lot of businesses that probably will never come back,” predicted Wilkerson, who serves on the development authority.
Charlotte Kelley, co-owner of 97 Main Salon, said customers kept asking in recent weeks to sneak in a back door to have their hair done or get electrolysis to remove hair, a particularly up close procedure. She declined. She also opposed earlier petitions to allow salons to serve a single customer at a time, worrying about safety and logistics.
Now that salons can reopen under Kemp’s order, she’d still rather not, because she remains worried about safety. But she said she will reopen anyway — with numerous protections in place — because her workers need the money and rent is costly. “Financially we have to do it,” Kelley said.
Hand sanitizer, flour and 3D videos
At Hope Springs Distillery earlier this year, Dahlberg, a former attorney, was busy planning a new rose-flavored gin and an elderflower liqueur with her husband, Paul Allen, a former industrial engineer. Now in their third year of business, they had been ahead of schedule, expecting to break even soon.
Instead, with the arrival of COVID-19, sales runs were called off. Bars closed. Their distributor didn’t reorder cases of the distillery’s vodka, gin and absinthe.
The couple quickly decided to make alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including giving some to the city police department. Demand boomed for the eight-ounce bottles at $7 a pop. Early on they sparked a traffic jam down Railroad Avenue and around the corner onto Main Street, requiring police officers to direct the flow.

After 1,500 bottles of sanitizer, the couple is making hundreds more, rationing sales to people who email in advance and get confirmed time slots to stop by.
Still, overall sales remain down.
“Some nights it is real hard,” she said. “Some nights I say, ‘What the hell.’ A lot of people have worse problems.”
Jennifer and Tony Tiberia’s 1910 Public House, a farm-to-table restaurant, had almost no delivery or takeout sales before the pandemic struck. They went from Friday and Saturday nights with typical hour-plus waits to worrying about how they could make payroll, which can hit $65,000 a month between their two restaurants, including Sprig in Decatur.
First, they consolidated menus, shortened operating hours and devised more family-oriented meals for takeout. Then they became mini-grocers after realizing customers needed products hard to find in grocery stores but available through restaurant suppliers. Among the offerings: paper towels, latex gloves, flour and uncooked ground beef and chicken breasts. 1910 Public House owners Jennifer (left) and Tony Tiberia pose for a photo inside their restaurant in downtown Lilburn.

The restaurant’s sales are off by 50%, but many staffers are getting shifts again, including former waiters making deliveries.
Before the coronavirus, Tiberia had planned to open a coffee shop and another restaurant across Main Street. But she’s having second thoughts, worried that consumers will be slow to return to eating near strangers.
While Kemp’s order permits the resumption of in-dining, the couple has leaned toward staying focused on takeout, but allowing people who pick up their meals to eat them on an outdoor patio, with no waiter present.
Mecredy, who owns MOMS, had to stop holding concerts in his backyard amphitheater. The first show of the season was supposed to be Saturday. It’s unclear when concerts will resume; live entertainment venues still aren’t allowed to reopen.
Mecredy, though, who opened his business nine years ago, was stunned that 80% of MOMS students taking music lessons agreed to switch to online classes. That has kept the enterprise afloat. Scott Mecredy, owner of Music on Main Street, poses for a photo outside the business in downtown Lilburn. He was amazed so many parents were willing to try a new way to have their kids stick with music lessons and were anxious to help keep the business afloat.

Jonathan Hillyard is one of the few — if not the only — business owners in downtown Lilburn who can claim rising sales amid the pandemic. His three-year-old Connext Media was mostly focused on serving local real estate agents, and he worried he would have to furlough staff.
But while some work dried up, Hillyard said he saw an even bigger surge from real estate agents interested in 3D virtual tours of homes. With open houses and showings put on hold, the videos offered prospective homebuyers another way to look inside. Business at his video production company jumped 30% in one month, he said.
He knows others haven’t been as fortunate. He said his mother was laid off from a job after 30 years at a home décor showroom inside AmericasMart. She got a week’s severance. His drive to work is also eye-opening.
The scene in downtown Lilburn has been “kind of eerie.” For many businesses, he added,“everything is on pause.” In downtown Lilburn, 1910 Public House restaurant server/bartender Greg Thompson prepares a curbside pickup of a customer order: a meal and grocery staples such as toilet paper.

Georgia Reopens Amid COVID-19 Fears. 	"A handful of businesses are once again open across Georgia, and the hands-on nature of some of those shops has many worried.
At Tony’s Barber Studio in Atlanta, the COVID-19 outbreak has cut business to its core. - Advertisement -
“We’ve been a month and two weeks without any salary,” Tony Roberts says.
It was that financial strain that pushed Roberts to open his doors, but the decision comes with risks.
In barbershops, nail salons, and other businesses given the green light to reopen, it can be almost impossible to maintain social distancing.
“I was baffled at the governor’s decision to be honest because there are still people dying, the numbers are going up, so I had mixed emotions,” Roberts says.
Officials in Oklahoma and Alaska are easing restrictions and opening some retail shops as well. Tennessee and Ohio are doing the same next week.
At the same time, governors in Illinois, North Carolina, and Michigan are extending current stay at home orders and keeping businesses closed, with everyone keeping a close eye on Georgia to see how its aggressive re-opening plan works out. "

Deadly Corona virus may have Originated in Tasmania. 	"The Corona virus, currently causing panic throughout China and alarm around the world, may have first cropped up on a small farm in northern Tasmania.
Retired farmer, Steven French, disclosed recently that he may inadvertently be the person responsible for the virus that could cause the death of everyone on the planet.
The World Health Organisation has convened an emergency meeting in an attempt to address this diabolical threat that has jumped species – from animals to humans. Corona virus initially manifests in humans with cold-like symptoms and it is all down-hill from there.
Steven French explained, “last year I kissed my donkey. A week later I had a cold. Around that time I met a Chinaman who must have caught it from me and taken it back to his own country. I distinctly remember coughing all over him. If I had known what the consequences were going to be I would have put my hand over my mouth.”
French went on to say that he would like to apologise in advance for killing everyone on the planet. “It was the last thing on my mind when I kissed my donkey” he said.
When told of this news, Tasmanian’s new Premier-elect Peter Gutwein was of the opinion that it would well and truly put Tasmania on the map. “Over the years Tasmania has been responsible for a lot of extinction events. We gave it a good shot with our local Aboriginals and really hit our straps with the extermination of the thylacine,” Gutwein said.
“For Tasmania to have initiated an extinction event of this magnitude shows that we continue to punch well above our weight,” he concluded.
Robert Wardle, speaking on behalf of the Tasmanian micro brewing industry, said that his organisation is outraged. “Seeing as the virus originated in Tasmania it should have been named after a Tasmanian beer,” Wardle said as he downed a long neck. “It is offensive that our virus has been named after some foreign muck. For heaven’s sake Corona is not even a decent beer. You have to put a slice of lemon in it to disguise the taste so that people will drink it”.
“Besides,” he added, “fingerbanging the bottle with a wodge of fruit is not really the relationship that Tasmanians are looking to have with beer.”
“At last count we have 38 micro breweries in this state,” Wardle continued. “Any one of them would have been proud to have their name attached to this new virus. As an organisation we are currently looking at registering provenance for this new Tasmanian export.”
An attempt to contact French for further comment failed. It is believed that he is somewhere in Hobart after raising $1,000 through crowd funding. Apparently the money was raised to finance French’s trip so that he can cough all over Eric Abetz.
Frenchy is the poorly disguised pseudonym of a seventh generation Tasmanian, former photo/journalist and magazine editor. Frenchy is pretty much retired and lives on a small farm in northern Tasmania with his wife, donkey and dog (in no particular order)."
if the Gates-Corona-Virus is able to spread to 1 of 3 ppl and the mortality rate is as high as 50%?!!! or more. 	"then it means that unless a population is fully segregated and removed local reinfections can occur and continue into full maturity of the human population (all people exposed, infected and unaffected exposed carriers and are able to spread the virus continually???, it wont ever end because of mutations???) and that only fully isolated populations without infections will be able to have children who wont need to be vaccinated??? possibly in utero???
we don't know yet how the virus interacts with pregnancy.
this can-will become the end of the human race,
or the end of the natural human community that we carry such a killing beast within us.
one or the other very quickly.

Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected Patients. 	"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (“S-Trimer”) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag © technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.
“I am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses”.
“We are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.”

About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
The new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus."

Baga Scientists Determine Origin Of Corona Virus. 	"Early this morning Baga scientists released a detailed report on the inappropriately named coronavirus. The report contains the results of an initial 24 hour study where Nosh and Ruptor drank 17 cases of Corona without limes and were then observed for a fortnight continually playing drinking games (with various light beer) using a communal coffee mug with several students from the Eta Pi sorority at a local university. Neither participant in the study suffered flu-like symptoms. One sorority member toiled through several acts of emesis but the incidents were deemed simply a contest related event.
In a second concurrent study, one student at Peking University, Web Long Wong, consumed 1/3 of a local brew playing Quarters against himself, and he and 2200 other students were dead by week’s end. The beer in question is a bat-infused IPA from Chairman Babe Brew Company, LLC. Chairman Babe Brewing Company, LLC 
Baga Scientists immediately issued the following statement: “The beer in question has an enjoyable fruity and resinous character with a wonderful hoppy aroma but a very bad finish indeed. Just sayin’. ”
Baga personnel are advised to remain calm and consume only North American brews until the scope of the severely under-reported pandemic is finally accurately reported. In the interim, the Baga Bunker is preparing for an influx of Baga refugees. Once the death toll on Long Island reaches 6, we recommend using rural roads to head south for safety. The Bunker will admit any Baga active or retired and 2 of their hottest family members. The bunker is equipped with several Base X 303 Shelters accommodating 12 persons each. There will be a 14 day quarantine period before refugees are permitted access to the Bunker itself."
GenScript ProBio Screens anti-2019 nCoV Antibodies in. 	" On February 4, 4:46 a.m., escorted by public security officers, 8 transgenic mice for fully human antibodies immunized with antigen from 2019 nCoV from Rongchang District, Chongqing were brought by Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. to Nanjing. These ""anti-2019 nCoV"" mice are provided to* GenScript Biologics Development Business Unit (now known as GenScript ProBio)* for emergency antibody drug screening in response to 2019 nCoV pneumonia.
*In 12 hours, GenScript ProBio successfully screened specific antibodies that recognize viral proteins and potentially block binding of virus to cellular receptors. *In less than 24 hours, using the *Beacon single-cell platform*, GenScript ProBio completed immunized mice processing, immune cell isolation and enrichment, single cell sorting, on-chip binding and blocking screening, which usually takes three months using the traditional hybridoma antibody screening. This contributes to the breakthrough in anti-2019 nCoV antibody screening.* GenScript is China's first CDMO that applies the world's leading digital Beacon Platform in antibody discovery services.*
In fact, as early as January 23 before the rapid outbreak, Discovery Department Head of GenScript ProBio, initiated the collaboration for an emergency screening project against 2019 nCoV together with Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. The project team discussed the protocol details from antigen immunization to anti-2019 nCoV antibody characterization. For such emergency antibody drug project, the core lies in rapid antibody generation. This involves seamless integration of screening, sequencing and vector synthesis and further development to fight the 2019 nCoV outbreak. We finally worked out the optimal solution of rapid immunization coupled with GenScript ProBio Beacon single-cell platform screening and had multiple alternatives.
*Dr. Brian Min, CEO of GenScript ProBio, said: **""**Our mission is to accelerate drug development through innovation and collaboration. I am confident that we will defeat the virus by working diligently together with our customers.* ""
After successful antibody sequence screening, the team will work on expression of those antibody genes, and will perform further virus blocking and neutralization tests for the expressed antibodies. These Emergency antibodies after validation are expected to be put into mass production in GenScript ProBio to fight 2019 nCoV.

corona-bioweapon. 	"The fear of the virus will be that no one will get anything from there economically, which will badly damage China. accordingly, anything made there will now cost more.
Also, if the demand for oil decreases and oil prices fall (the tension is not reflected in us, and we also increase our currency) A friend of mine had already told me a few weeks ago that Russia's economy would be attacked by lowering oil prices. If economic production falls in China, China's demand for oil will also decrease, which will cause economic distress to many countries, especially Iran.
My comment: That's a good point. China uses Iran's oil. If for any reason China's economy slows, Iran and Russia are going to feel it. That would be a great reason to ship a virus to China, that white people seem to be more resistant to than the Chinese - to weaken China, Russia, and Iran before a war .

DOH: Tests confirm Chinese boy in Cebu negative for 2019-nCoV. 	"The five-year-old Chinese boy in Cebu City, who was diagnosed with an unspecified coronavirus, has been confirmed to be negative from the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), the Department of Health (DOH) announced Friday evening.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III
“This is indeed very welcome news to ease the Filipinos’ growing concern,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III in a statement.
The test was performed at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia.
The DOH previously said that the child manifested “pneumonia-like symptoms and with a history of travel from Wuhan, China.” The boy was admitted to a health facility in Cebu City for investigation.
“We will continue to monitor the developing situation and ensure mechanisms to contain the threat of the 2019-nCoV,” Duque said. “I assure everyone that your Department of Health will not stop here and is on top of this emerging health event.”
The health chief said that the Bureau of Quarantine is still on alert and closely working with airlines and airport authorities “for stricter border surveillance.”
“DOH recommends all travelers with symptoms of fever and cough, and with history of travel to Wuhan, China to immediately proceed to any hospital for prompt medical attention and management,” Duque said.
“DOH assures [the public] that its health facilities are equipped and prepared to receive suspected cases of the 2019-nCoV. Health workers are advised to observe preventive measures and infection control protocols.”
Duque also advised the public to remain vigilant and always practice good personal hygiene, observe cough etiquette, and strengthen the immune system."

Corona Virus: How to Protect Yourself. 	" Even though I wish to believe that I had something to do with this beautiful story, because my introduction of the specialist niche carmaker Xavier de le Chapelle to an Indian business group that had plans to make a sports car in India, was the genesis of this story, it is perhaps just a fond wish. De la Chapelle’s project died when the main Indian investor died, but Xavier’s many visits to India might have had some influence in convincing his son, Cédric de la Chapelle, a guitarist from the Lyon scene, to retrace his father’s innumerable visits to India. At the same time, there is no denying that it is very much possible that Cédric would have got to India, even without the De La Chapelle sports car project history. Either way, it came to pass that Cédric and Marion, his fiancée then and his wife now, whilst looking for a place to stay at Calangute, in Goa, bumped into Joseph Manuel Da Rocha, a frail 64-years-old man, who made ends meet by brokering hotel rooms to tourists. Amused and charmed by this unassuming old man, Cédric and Marion caught up with Da Rocha again, and with one beer leading to another, music and songs followed. Captivated by the old man’s voice, Cédric recorded him singing a cappella. “When I got back to France,” reminisces Cédric, “I talked to several musician friends about the idea, and little by little, we formed this group, which we decided to call Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident.” Cédric de la Chapelle is, incidentally, a redhead. “It was only in 2009 that we were able to bring Joe to France for our first concert at the Trans Musicales in Rennes,” says Cédric, “as it took us a while before we could get his paperwork sorted out in India. He used to have a passport, but that had expired in 2000. So, a new passport had to be generated, and it was the monsoons in Goa… and that took some three or four months.” Born on 22 March 1943, in Mumbai, Joseph Manuel Da Rocha lived the life of a waster, a wandering poet, living on the margins of society, smoking, drinking and doing drugs. Thus, when Cédric met Slow Joe, he had quite a history of drug and alcohol addiction, but had somewhat straightened out his life, working as a guide in Goa. More importantly, he had an innate musical talent and a rare crooner’s voice, one, which bewitched Cédric as soon as he heard the old man sing. Thus, that chance encounter on the beaches of Goa changed the lives of these two men, and marked the start of an amazing adventure. Cédric and his original band mates—Lucas Spirli on keyboards, Alexis Morel-Journel on bass, and Josselin Varengo on drums—helped Slow Joe build up a repertoire of new songs and formed a group around him, which was The Ginger Accident. With their very successful first concert at the 2009 edition of the Trans Musicales in Rennes, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident hit the headlines in France. In no time, they were the darling of the media, as concert spectators as well as critics took to the music and the story of this cute, but frail, old man, with that deep, gravelly voice, booming over a mix of slow rock, spiced with blues and jazz riffs. In 2011, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident released their first album Sunny Side Up , and the success of the album was reflected by a sell-out tour of France, followed by a European tour across Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. In December 2011, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident came 'home' to India, for a tour of the country, performing in Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, Bangalore, Jaipur, Kolkata, Pondicherry, Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Organised by the Alliance Française, the band did not get the coverage they deserved. In 2014, when Slow Joe was 71, a second album, Lost for Love , was released to even greater critical acclaim, with a newer rendering of Slow Joe’s song Cover me Over, a track from his first album, but this time, sung in duet with the Franco-Israeli star, Yael Naim. By early 2016, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident had performed at over 250 concerts. In May 2016, when Slow Joe was just 73 years old, he had a fatal heart attack. This was when a third album was nearing completion. Titled Let Me Be Gone, the album was released posthumously, in February 2017, and has since risen to the top of the French charts. With Slow Joe’s passing, the band too has disbanded, out of sadness and respect for the memory of that lovable old Indian. There have been several eulogies in the French press and talks of a film on this sweet story have been doing the rounds. “That would be the best tribute to Slow Joe,” acknowledges Cédric, as he concentrates on other projects, in the meantime. ( Author of several automotive books, founder editor of many leading auto mags, Gautam Sen has also consulted with most of the Indian auto majors. He has also worked with several leading car designers such as Gérard Godfroy, Tom Tjaarda and Marcello Gandini, among others.

YCP virus more fatal than Corona, says Naidu. 	"Hundreds of Chinese citizens are dying due to Corona virus while thousands more are getting infected. The infection is spreading fast to other countries. But, TDP boss Chandrababu Naidu says that the YCP virus is wreaking greater havoc with the AP state as major industries are migrating to other states one by one in just eight months of Jagan Reddy Regime. Undoubtedly, YCP virus is more dangerous than Corona and it’s upto the people to cure this killer disease, says Naidu.
The opposition leader’s comments come in the wake of Reliance Electronics Industry going away from Tirupati. This video following the Jaganmohan Reddy government’s announcement to take back Reliance lands and re-allot them to the homeless poor people.
Naidu recalled how the Asia Paper, Singapore Consortium, Kia Accessories Manufacturers, Franklin Templeton and other major industries have already left the state. Now, CM and Ministers have set their sights on Millennium Towers in Vizag in the name of shifting Secretariat there. This is driving away many IT companies from there. Nearly, 18,000 youth are losing jobs because of this. Telugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists."
"Futures Hit Record High On Optimism That ""Corona Is Contained"". "	"And sure enough, less than 24 hours later, in an attempt to explain the return of overnight market euphoria Reuters writes that ""world stock markets looked to be getting back to full strength on Wednesday, as updates from China about the spread of a new flu-like coronavirus raised hopes the outbreak would be contained "" and Bloomberg doubled-down that ""U.S. equity-index futures gained on Wednesday as China took steps to contain the spread of a deadly virus"", which is ironic since just moments ago China's CCTV reported that there are now 473 confirmed Coronavirus cases in China , with many cases now observed internationally, and most recently, a Coronavirus case were confirmed in Hong Kong as the epidemic spreads. And yet, after dropping by 9 points yesterday, S&P futures have more than made up those losses and are up 14 points as of Wednesday morning.
China’s National Health Commission said on Wednesday there were 440 cases of the new virus, with nine deaths so far, and added that measures are now in place to minimize public gatherings in the most-affected regions. How one can prevent people from gathering in China, the world's most congested nation, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the outbreak has spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The World Health Organization meets later on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international emergency.
In other words, despite what a handful of algos would like to telegraph, the Coronavirus is anything but contained , with the outbreak reviving memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. And the punchline: according to Reuters, ""this time China’s response and candour — in contrast to the SARS epidemic — have helped reassure investors concerned about the possible global fallout."" Actually, the ""response and candour"" confirm, if anything, that China is panicking, but as usual the market is never wrong, until it is.
“The call here is not that the virus is done or nipped in the bud by any means,” said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “But there have been no big further reported outbreaks, and the response from the Chinese authorities has been very, very positive”.
""I would expect a lot of people - candidly, like we are - that are looking for opportunities to buy rather than sell” amid the dip in stocks caused by virus-contagion worries, Lamar Ville re, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co., said on Bloomberg TV. “I don’t think this is going to be the beginning of the end.”
Because one obviously ""buys rather then sells"" when stocks are trading at never before seen highs.
In any case, optimism that ""Corona is Contained"" helped European stocks in London, Frankfurt and Paris score early gains of 0.1% to 0.2%. European equities first erased initial gains to mirror whiplash price action for stocks in Asia, where early losses reversed after Beijing outlined measures to contain the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, however it has since rebounded again.
Earlier in the session, Asian stocks resumed their climb, rebounding from the last session led by consumer-staples and technology companies. The benchmark stock gauge recovered about half of Tuesday’s losses, with most markets in the region gaining. Shares in Hong Kong also rebounded, with technology stocks and insurers boosting the Hang Seng Index. Chinese shares erased losses after Beijing said it will start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.
MSCI’s airline industry index .posted its biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. Airline shares were still falling on Wednesday.
“While details on the coronavirus are scant, we reckon that the SARS period could offer some clues as to how markets could pan out,” analysts at Singapore’s DBS Bank said. “The trends are clear: Yields and stock prices fell in the first few months of the SARS outbreak and rebounded thereafter.”
And yes, the return of Fed-backstopped euphoria means a new record high in the US too where S&P 500 futures just hit a new all time high, reaching Michael Hartnett's target of 3,333 more than one month ahead of schedule (March 3).
In rates, US 10Y Treasurys were unchanged with the yield on U.S. 10-year government bonds stabilizing after Tuesday’s drop, sitting at 1.78% US10YT=RR in European trading. Core European and U.K. bond yields are also little changed across most of the curves. Italian government bond yields rose as much as 8 basis points on reports the leader of the country’s 5-Star party and foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, will step down, however they recovered all losses after it was confirmed that he is indeed stepping down. It was the biggest, if brief, sell-off in a month and raised the risk of another snap election in Europe’s fourth-largest economy, since 5-Star is part of Italy’s coalition government.
“The initial reaction was to sell because of the heightened political uncertainty,” said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit in Milan. “But there is no outright link between de Maio’s resignation and a collapse of the government.”
In FX, with markets generally rising, safe plays such as gold and the Japanese yen were weaker. The dollar was rising toward the highs it reached in December against the other top world currencies. The yen dipped after gaining Tuesday on news of the contagion and potential disruption to spending during China’s week-long Lunar New Year. The yuan steadied, after tumbling the most in almost five months Tuesday in onshore trading.
In commodities, gold gave back some gains to trade at $1,555 per ounce; West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $58 a barrel and natural gas gained 1% to $1.91 per mmbtu.

Asian equity markets gradually improved and shrugged off the lacklustre lead from Wall St, where all major indices snapped their streak of record closes amid jitters related to the coronavirus with 440 cases reported in China and the death toll now at 9, while the CDC also confirmed the first case of the virus in the US. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) managed to rebound from opening weakness as outperformance in Consumer Staples, Tech and Healthcare underpinned the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment was mainly driven by currency moves but with weakness seen in some automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using emission cheating devices. KOSPI (+1.2%) gained with Hyundai Motor boosted amid earnings despite missing expectations on Q4 net as it still showed a turnaround from the loss Y/Y and both its operating profit and revenue topped forecasts.

Finally, 10yr JGBs were indecisive amid a pullback in T-notes which retraced some of the prior day’s advances after hitting resistance around 129.20 and with prices also failing to benefit despite slightly firmer demand at the enhanced-liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs.

A choppy session for European stocks thus far [EuroStoxx 50 -0.2%], with a mixed performance across regional bourses and following on from a mostly positive APAC handover. Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows – on the back of Di Maio’s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader. On the other end of the spectrum, SMI (+0.6%) outperforms with almost all of its stocks in positive territory. Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall market sentiment. In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+1.7%) shares are supported after a source noted that Boeing doesn’t expect regulators to sign off on the 737 Max until June or July, months later than the manufacturer previously expected. Traders also attribute the losses in Tui (-4.3%) to the Boeing news. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete.

In FX, although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China’s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday’s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning? JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD - The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs. Elsewhere, Sterling is rangy in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms either side of 1.3050 and 0.8500 awaiting Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs that could well be the final jigsaw pieces for next week’s BoE policy meeting, and similarly the Loonie is biding time between 1.3050-1.3100 in the run up to Canadian CPI just before the BoC. EM - The Rand continues its recovery from worst levels after in line SA CPI and last week’s surprise SARB ease prompted Usd/Zar upside to test the 200 DMA yesterday, but also as the Dollar stalls after another look at the same DXY chart resistance level around 97.720. However, the Rouble is fading after a fleeting relief rally on the formation of a new Russian Government alongside oil prices towards 62.0000 again.
In commodities, WTI and Brent front-month futures remain lacklustre in mid-week trade – with participants pointing dampened sentiment on the coronavirus outbreak alongside demand woes for the complex, amid lower demand from airlines in light of cancelled flights ahead of the Chinese Lunar Year. Bearish supply-side fundamentals also weigh on the futures as EIA expects US total shale oil production to rise by 22k BPD in February to 9.2mln, with a predominant increase by the Permian. WTI meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the Brent contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar’20 futures test yesterday’s low just above 64/bbl. As a reminder, the weekly API Private crude inventories will be released later today on account of Monday’s MLK US market holiday. Spot gold prices have clambered off overnight lows after a test of the 1550/oz to the downside and ahead of potential modest resistance at its 50 HMA (~1559/oz) which did cap gains in the yellow metal during yesterday’s session.

A look at my Davos stats from yesterday shows around 20,000 steps and 10 miles of trekking around town to various meetings and events. I think 3 miles of that was taking a forced detour as Mr Trump’s motorcade came through town. We hosted a fascinating panel on sustainability pitting NYT best selling author Andrew McAfee who’s written an optimistic tome (More From Less) against Tim Jackson - an ecological economist - who has written a more pessimistic book (Prosperity Without Growth). It made for a lively debate and in all my interactions its clear that the number of these conversations are rising exponentially. In talking about our Davos piece on this topic (link here) at a separate meeting, one client explained one of the dilemmas they face. They invest in African development and mentioned that surely everyone would want health improvements in the continent - especially the poorer parts. However his assertion was that the only way that can happen in the immediate future is if their energy consumption increases which in turn potentially damages the planet. Raising the awareness of such trade-offs is one of the main themes of our report and this is where more and more attention needs to be focused.
It’s fair to say that the two headline grabbers of Davos yesterday have different views on the issue. President Trump said that “we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse”. It’s fair to say Greta Thunberg took the polar opposite view. Elsewhere in Mr Trump’s speech, he trumpeted the achievements of his administration, criticised the Federal Reserve once again for not cutting rates fast enough, and also said that talks with China on phase two would start “very shortly”. Later on, ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said that “we’re going to talk about a big trade deal” and that it was “something that we all want to be able to make.” However, Trump also said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he was “absolutely serious” when it comes to putting tariffs on European cars if a trade deal couldn’t be reached.
In terms of today at Davos, Von der Leyen will actually be one of the main speakers, with an address at 11:30 CET, while there’s a potentially interesting panel on the future of financial markets a bit earlier at 10:30 CET, which includes IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, along with the US and UK finance ministers, Steven Mnuchin and Sajid Javid.
Back to markets, and equities sold off yesterday as the US returned from a holiday, with investors becoming a bit more cautious around the world amidst the continued spread of a new coronavirus in China. Reports that a case had been discovered in the US helped reverse a gradual rally back in markets prior to the last couple of hours of US trading. More on the US session below but the latest on the virus is that with the death toll increasing to 9 from 6, China is likely to start nationwide screening as officials are stepping up the monitoring of transportation links in the country. The confirmed cases of the infection have reached 440 as of January 21 (from 218 on January 20) and 1,394 patients are under medical observation. Including the detection in the US, the virus has now stretched to 5 additional countries with Macau reporting its first case overnight. Elsewhere, the WHO is going to decide today as to whether to declare the virus an international public health emergency. China has said that as of now it has seen no evidence of “super spreaders” - infected people who pass on the disease rapidly to many other people - but could not rule out that some would emerge. Super spreaders played a key role in the SARS pandemic 17 years ago, which killed almost 800 people and hurt economies across the region.
Assessing the economic impact of the coronavirus, our Asian economists draw conclusions from the past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (link here) and conclude that the impact from any spread of the disease would be felt most in the form of a sharp decline in retail sales, tourism, hotel & catering and travel activities as people try to avoid infection by restricting travel and people to people contact. Also, if necessary, public health measures might get introduced to reduce infections by imposing quarantines and closing schools which could result in a higher impact. But most other services and trade and manufacturing activities are unlikely to be affected much, in their view; and consumption and travel can be expected to recover quickly, even before the authorities give the all clear as observed during the SARS and MERS outbreak. The big problem is that as the Lunar New Year holidays approach it might prove hard for China to contain. Some good news is that China have been forthcoming and transparent about the spread of this coronavirus as they involved the WHO very early on and have also shared the genetic sequencing of the virus to allow early detection of cases in other countries. This is unlike what happened with SARS which first came to light in China in November 2002 but only got widespread attention after the first cases were detected in Hong Kong in February 2003.
Overnight in Asia, markets are making advances as investors are moderating their concerns over the virus. The Nikkei (+0.59%), Hang Seng (+1.25%) and Kospi (+1.00%) are all up. Meanwhile, the CSI (+0.08%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.02%) are trading flattish. As for Fx, the Japanese yen is down -0.15% while most Asian currencies are making modest advances. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.47% and yields on 10y USTs are up +1.2bps while, gold is trading down -0.33% and oil prices are down -0.40%. As for overnight data releases, South Korea’s preliminary 4Q GDP printed at +2.2% yoy (vs. +1.9% yoy expected).
Before this the S&P 500 fell back from its record high from Friday, ending the session down -0.26%. It was a similar story elsewhere, with the NASDAQ (-0.19%) and the Dow Jones (-0.52%) also seeing declines. Boeing (-3.33%) saw another tough session. Before this in Europe, the STOXX 600 pulled back from its intraday low of -0.99% to close just -0.14% lower. Nevertheless the risk-off sentiment supported sovereign debt, with 10yr Treasuries down -5.7bps to 1.766%, while the 2s10s curve flattened by -2.5bps. Gilt yields fell -1.9bps to their lowest level since October, while bunds (-3.1bps) and OATs (-3.0bps) also saw yields move lower. Italy was the exception, where the spread of BTPs over bunds widened by +4.9bps ahead of lots of political news flow of late and a regional election on Sunday. That said, they’re still holding the 150-170bps range seen since mid-November so it’ll be interesting to see if political risk leads to a break out.
Looking at yesterday’s earnings, UBS shares fell -4.53% after the company reported that last year’s net profit attributable to shareholders was down -5% year-on-year, with the bank also lowering their targets moving forward. Bank stocks were subdued generally yesterday, with the STOXX Banks index closing down -0.47% at a one-month low, though UBS isn’t a member of that particular index.
Staying with earnings, Netflix reported overnight and said that it added 8.76mn subscribers in 4Q (+20% yoy). However, it forecasted slower subscriber growth in the current quarter at 7mn (vs. 7.82mn) expected. The stock was up +2.38% in afterhours trading. IBM also reported with a slight beat. The stock was up +3.83% after hours.
Over in FX, sterling was the strongest-performing G10 currency yesterday, as the UK employment numbers ended a run of pretty weak data from the country. The 3m/3m employment change rose to +208k (vs. +110k expected) in November, its highest rate since January, while the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations. In response, investors lowered the odds of a rate cut from the BoE at next week’s meeting after the data release, with the chances falling to around 60%, having been at 70.5% at the close on Friday. Our economists point out (link here) though that most of yesterday’s announced employment gains have been government led so it shouldn’t change the view on a necessary rate cut too much. The last big data release before the BoE meeting will be the preliminary January PMIs on Friday, so the market will be paying close attention.
Meanwhile in Germany, the ZEW Survey beat expectations, with the current situation reading rising to -9.5 (vs. -13.5 expected), while the expectations reading rose to 26.7 (vs. 15.0 expected), the strongest reading for the expectations indicator since July 2015. So a note of optimism ahead of tomorrow’s ECB meeting.
In terms of the day ahead there are a number of key highlights. From central banks, the Bank of Canada will be deciding on rates, while Bank of England Governor Carney will be speaking at the Bloomberg Climate Forum in Davos. Earnings releases out today include Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, ASML and Texas Instruments. Finally on the data, we’ll get French business confidence in January, Italian industrial sales and industrial orders from November, UK public sector net borrowing for December, Canada’s December CPI reading, and finally US existing home sales for December and the FHFA house price index for November.

Filipina quarantined in Hong Kong due to 2019-nCoV to be released. 	"A Filipina migrant worker in Hong Kong who was allegedly exposed to an elderly couple infected with new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will be released Friday midnight, the Philippine consulate confirmed Thursday.
The Filipina was placed under strict quarantine last Jan. 23 at the Maclehose Holiday Camp in Sai Kung town.
In a text message to ABS-CBN News, Consul General Raly Tejada said the Department of Health (DOH) will be taking care of the Filipina's further health necessities.
The Filipina has been consistently asymptomatic and healthy from the time she was put under quarantine, authorities said.
Health officials said she came into contact with the elderly couple, the parents of her employer, after they came from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
The couple reportedly arrived in Hong Kong via high-speed rail on January 22, before they both developed fever over the next two days and were hospitalized. The couple had been staying with their daughter, who lived at the Lake Silver Estate in Ma On Shan.
Tejada said the Filipina will still be working for her employers.
""Walang sakit yan. Cleared na siya - she will be taken to her residence (employers), which has been sanitized by the Health Department,"" he said.
On Feb. 5, the consulate confirmed that a second Filipino domestic worker was put under quarantine. The Filipina, under observation, is also asymptomatic and healthy."
Is Corona Beer experiencing the AIDS/Ayds effect?. 	"David's post about the rise in Google searches for ""coronavirus beer,"" ""corona virus beer,"" and ""virus corona beer"" in the last few days, brings to mind the sad fate of Ayds.
Ayds (pronounced aids) was a popular appetite-suppressant candy from the 1930s-1980s. When public awareness about AIDS grew in the mid-80s, sales of Ayds declined. Eventually Ayds went out of business. From Wikipedia :
By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease.[3] While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market.

Effectively Tackling Corona Virus By Tony Ademiluyi. 	"A pastor friend of mine told me that it was one of the signs of the end times as strange ailments now plague the human climate. by Tony Ademiluyi Feb 11, 2020
Shortly before the celebration of the lunar year by the Chinese, the world was alerted to the emergence of the corona virus in the Wuhan province of China.
A pastor friend of mine told me that it was one of the signs of the end times as strange ailments now plague the human climate.
On January 28, some cases of deaths as a result of the virus had been reported but by February 10, the death rate had escalated to close to a thousand with about forty thousand people said to be affected.
This ailment is worse than that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 that claimed over seven hundred lives.
Now that the lunar year celebrations have come to an end, there are palpable fears of a possible spread of the virus by the Chinese when they go back to their respective bases outside the country.
We recall that the former Super Eagles Striker, Jude Odion Ighalo had to be quarantined for a fortnight by his new club, Manchester United before being allowed to join his team mates. Think of the various Chinese interests especially in Africa and how this will greatly affect the world’s second largest continent when these people go back to their various destinations there.
Let us take the case of Nigeria. Do we have what it takes to halt a spread of it by the Chinese when they return here? We recall some years ago when the Ebola virus broke out. A Liberian former minister who had the virus surreptitiously passed through our porous immigration system and ended up at the First Consultants Hospital where the late heroine, Dr. Stella Ameyo Adadevoh prevented him from leaving and lost her life in the process as she wasn’t adequately protected.
Does our medical system have what it takes to contain this deadly virus? The west is yet to develop a vaccine to effectively counter it; how on earth will we cope especially with the recent policy of visas at the point of entry which was pronounced last year. Are we not in for a gargantuan epidemic?
Recently, there was a huge cry by most of the Nigerian residents in China at the apparent neglect of their plight by the Nigerian Government. This is not new given the lack of empathy by successive Nigerian governments to the plight of her citizens in foreign nations. Not too long ago, the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyeama had to use his airline to evacuate many Nigerians from South Africa who were fleeing the xenophobic attacks by their host country. There is no sturdy plan on ground to attend to the health needs of the hundreds of thousands of Nigerians resident there like many sane countries are doing. Many countries have promulgated travel bans to China for the meantime till the crisis abates and many are evacuating their citizens from there. As usual no proactive action by the Nigerian Government is in place for the hapless Nigerian citizens there.
China is currently on a lock down as their stock market is down with many of her factories closed down till further notice. Forty million people are currently being quarantined. The Director-General of the World Health Organization commended the Chinese Government for doing its best to contain the virus and keep many people resident in the country out of harm’s way.
A trader friend of mine told me that he made a killing selling face masks to the Chinese Government as the price for them keeps skyrocketing day by day. I trust my countrymen to make the best use of any crisis to their advantage especially economically.
An emergency fund should be set aside by the Nigerian Government to deal with the challenge that will emanate from this health challenge. The health sector should work hand in hand with their foreign counterparts to ensure that the deadly virus doesn’t spread here. Prevention is better than cure since the vaccines to cure it hasn’t yet been developed as at the time of the writing of this piece.
The government should also spare a thought for its citizens in that country. All hands must be on deck to ensure that the welfare of our citizens in the country that prides herself as the fastest growing economy in the globe is taken care of. What happened in South Africa must not repeat itself there.
We are hopeful that we shall rise above this disease and shall truly overcome. At the end of the day, we shall look back in joy and smile at our collective effort in fighting the ailment.

United Arab Emirates Confirms Four Cases Of Corona Virus. 	United Arab Emirates Confirms Four Cases Of Corona Virus Four new cases of the deadly corona virus have been confirmed by the UAE in the Middle East from a family that just returned from a city at the centre of the outbreak in China. The UAE's Ministry of Health said on Wednesday it had diagnosed the Corona virus in the Chinese family. Those diagnosed with the virus were in stable condition and under medical observation, the ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency WAM.It's not immediately clear how many people have been infected by the virus but health officials are monitoring the situation. Corona virus has so far killed at least 132 people and infected some 6,000 others globally, surpassing the number of cases diagnosed during the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003.From Aljazeera *Nigeria should be ready....that is if the virus has not entered already but yet to be detected....OMG....this will not be good at all...with Lassa fever still being battled and all.. God please forgive us!!!
"The Corona Virus and the PLAGUE OF CORRUPTION - ""Boy, Do I Hate Being Right All the Time!"". "	"WE NEED TO STOP EXPERIMENTING ON VIRUSES IN ANIMAL AND HUMAN TISSUE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR INTENTIONS, YOU ARE CREATING MONSTERS WHICH CAN DEVASTATE THE HUMAN RACE AND YOU CAN NEVER CONTROL THEM. THEY WILL BREAK FREE.
I'm not sure how I can state it more clearly. Yes, that makes me an Anti-Vaxxer, but it also makes me somebody who claims we need to SHUT-DOWN this type of research immediately.
Let me review some of the media reports and posts by experts which have led me to this conclusion. The Washington Times had an article from January 27, 2020 entitled "" China Silent Amid Growing Doubts Over Corona-Virus Origins.""
Here are a couple samples from that article: ""China's government stood silent Monday in the face of growing scientific reports that the source of the deadly Wuhan virus outbreak did not originate solely from a seafood market in the city . . . Suspicions about a link to a biological warfare leak in Wuhan have been raised because the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory handles deadly viruses and its civilian and military research are intertwined in China . . . The State Department said in a report last year that is suspects China is working covertly on offensive biological weapons . . .""
The article is saying that the alleged ""bat soup"" origin of the virus from the local seafood market is shaky, at best.
But guess what???
You should know that the scientists in Wuhan were studying bats and corona viruses because the immune system of bats seems to be able to suppress the virus. What an amazing coincidence!
Zero Hedge published an article on February 1, ""Corona Virus Contains 'HIV insertions,' Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon."""
CORONA VIRUS NOW JUST 327 MILES FROM EMILY THORNBERRY. 	The deadly Corona Virus is now reported to be closer than ever to Emily Thornberry, Britain's least liked and most loathed politician, who is paradoxically running to become leader of the Labour Party. The news comes after reports that the Chinese super-virus had reached Edinburgh , where five people are now under observation for symptoms. If the disease has indeed reached Edinburgh, this means it is only 327 miles from Thornberry's Islington South and Finsbury constituency, greatly narrowing the chances of the Labour MP, who is widely considered to be a fat sneering hypocrite, being infected. Of course, in such a battle there could only be one winner, as no virus could survive contact with such a toxic individual, who would therefore unwittingly save the world with her coarse laughter, tank-like physiognomy, dead-eyed sneer, and all round aura of putrid vileness.

Hospitals looking to gradually resume elective procedures postponed by COVID-19. 	"Hospitals and clinics in the US are moving to tentatively resume elective surgeries and other procedures that were postponed in response to COVID-19. David Hoyt, executive director of the American College of Surgeons, who is calling for a slow ramp-up in procedures, with close monitoring of community infection rates, remarked that ""testing [for the virus] would be ideal, if it was available and consistently accurate,"" but he said ""we would not recommend anyone would start [resuming elective procedures] like flipping a switch on.""
In response to the pandemic, some US states have either advised or forced hospitals to postpone various procedures, such as joint replacements and routine colonoscopies, among others not considered urgent, in a bid to prevent infection and conserve space and equipment for a potential surge of patients with COVID-19. The US government recently suggested that elective procedures could go ahead in locations where infection rates are declining, and when hospitals have adequate capacity and testing for high-risk workers. Several states, including California, Texas, New York and Ohio, are now working with healthcare providers to resume elective procedures.
A number of medical technology companies, including Edwards Lifesciences , Quest Diagnostics , Thermo Fisher and Roche Diagnostics have reported impacts on their first-quarter results as countries shifted resources away from routine testing and elective procedures to meet the growing demands of managing COVID-19. Johnson & Johnson saw medical device revenues fall 8.2% in the first quarter as a result of the pandemic, while Abbott said COVID-19 hit sales of its core diagnostics, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, and Intuitive Surgical reported a drop in da Vinci procedures in the latter half of March.
Meanwhile, Australian lawmakers are also looking to allow elective procedures to gradually resume in that country, including in vitro fertilisations, post-cancer procedures, such as breast reconstructions, joint replacements, eye procedures and endoscopies. Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said ""they'll start to be resumed on a sensible, safe and clinical needs-basis, to ensure we keep half an eye on the system in case there's any increase in COVID-19 numbers, while ensuring there's minimal risk to the patient and clinical staff."""
Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS [VIDEO]. 	"European Protest for Medical Freedom – Munich 2020 FREEDOM. Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS [VIDEO] Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS
In support of Lance Welton’s thesis below, that the coronavirus seems particularly aimed at Chinese people or, at least, that they seem to be the main victims of it – just like SARS, we link to an Al Jazeera report of 8 hours ago titled China coronavirus outbreak: All the latest updates – Global death toll reaches 427 with two reported dead outside mainland China as the number of infections passes 20,500 . Simply from the title itself, we can see that by far and away the largest % of deaths are among Chinese in China. One of the 2 dead ‘outside of China’, the second death in fact, is from Hong Kong , as reported in the first two paragraphs, meaning this person is racially, genetically Chinese. (A note to Al Jazeera : Hong Kong has been ‘inside’ of China politically since 1997. Further, it is not an island and is part of the mainland, although it contains several islands.)
This CNN story, linked to here (from Feb.3), reports on the first death due to the coronavirus of a Chinese man in the Philippines .
Why are we not being told this? Why, as per usual, are we being made to fear? Welton attempts to answer this below.
Credit to Paul Craig Roberts , who has alerted his readers to a Youtube video testifying to the fact that viruses can be targeted at populations with a certain racial/genetic profile. These racial profiles, or ‘genetic markers’, can easily be identified, thus enabling the production of bioweapons targeting certain people. Says Roberts, ‘For those who doubt that bioweapons can be targeted to specific races or ethnicities, here is a documentary describing how it is done’. We’re posting it below (starting at 41 mins, 20 seconds ):
Do You Know All Coronavirus Victims Appear To Be Chinese? Thought Not! LANCE WELTON
At the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published.
All of these deaths have been in China.
The disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020]. The Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians —specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as “ Oriental .”
Thus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC.com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be “Chinese nationals.” Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read “ First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , ” [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.
In fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a “Chinese tourist” [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].
If it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].
The authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens . Races—or, as they call them, “ethnic groups”—are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.
Many infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.
Thus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to “ natives ” in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries’ populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.
The Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.
According to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), a total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died – in France (where there were an atypically high 7 cases).
By contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17% . In Taiwan, it was 10% . In Canada, it was 17% , but it seems pretty obvious that they were all “ Chinese Canadians ,” what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to “help” them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization’s role in public health —a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].
In Singapore , 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.
But essentially, it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn’t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.
This effect was so pronounced that, Wikipedia reports , “Many Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.” (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons—a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists’ notorious desire to appease China).
The difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It‘s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].
So if I wanted to tempt fate, then I’d write the following:
The Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM’s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic. By not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans …so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than “race differences don’t exist, because race is a social construct.” But race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that."
Corona-vires: Has the Government exceeded its powers? . 	"This Government’s key message has been its ability get things done, whether it be Brexit, HS2 or stopping the spread of Coronavirus.
Indeed, if the new high speed trains move as swiftly as the Health Secretary did on Monday, then they might break the sound barrier: the were enacted at 6.50am on Monday and laid before Parliament by 2.30 that afternoon. Their preamble states that
the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.
One can appreciate the desire to bypass the cumbersome mechanics of Parliament to save the country from a potentially deadly virus. But in the fullness of time, the resulting Regulations might well be held up as an excellent advertisement for Parliamentary scrutiny.
The enabling Act
Secondary (or subordinate) legislation – such as regulations – is made by the executive under powers granted by ‘enabling’ primary legislation.
The enabling legislation cited in these Regulations is the . And its use in this case might be said to be straight out of 1984 .
The Coronavirus Regulations apply where the Secretary of State has issued a “ serious and imminent threat declaration” , which he also managed to do on Monday. They extend to England only.
The Regulations purport to derive their basis in law from specific sections of the 1984 Act: sections 45B, C, F and P. The first two of those sections merit a closer look.
is entitled “ Health Protection Regulations: international travel etc. ” It provides that the appropriate minister may by regulations make provision:
a. for preventing danger to public health from vessels, aircraft, trains or other conveyances arriving at any place,
b. for preventing the spread of infection or contamination by means of any vessel, aircraft, train or other conveyance leaving any place, and
c. for giving effect to any international agreement or arrangement relating to the spread of infection or contamination.
Among the non-exhaustive list of measures envisaged by sub-section 1 are provisions “ for the medical examination, detention, isolation or quarantine of persons. ” So in the context of “ international travel etc. ”, those coercive powers can clearly be the subject of Regulations.
deals with a separate context – it is entitled “ Health protection regulations: domestic ”. Section 45C(1) provides:
The appropriate Minister may by regulations make provision for the purpose of preventing against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in England and Wales (whether from risks originating there or elsewhere).
This would plainly encompass controlling the spread in England of a Coronavirus originating elsewhere.
This section has its own non-exhaustive list, which contains apparently less coercive measures than the international travel section does. The 45C list includes requiring medical practitioners to record and notify cases or suspected cases of infection or contamination, and keeping children away from school.
provides that the restrictions or requirements envisaged can include “ a special restriction or requirement ”. This is defined as a restriction or requirement which can be imposed by a justice of the peace under various provisions, including section 45G(2). These, in turn, include detention, isolation and quarantine, as a footnote to the 2020 Regulations points out.
However, the power to make regulations under section 45C(1) is subject to Not only does section 45C not expressly contain any power of detention, isolation or quarantine, section 45D(3) states that Regulations under section 45C “ may not include provision imposing a special restriction or requirement mentioned in section 45G(2)(a), (b), (c) or (d).” refers to a restriction or requirement “ that P be detained in a hospital or other suitable establishment ”, and 45G(2)(d) refers to a restriction or requirement “ that P be kept in isolation or quarantine”.
So that is what the primary legislation says. In summary, it makes clear that in the domestic context of disease control (as opposed to the international travel context) there is no power to make regulations imposing detention, isolation or quarantine on any person.
The Coronavirus Regulations
The secondary legislation provides at that the Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant (i.e. a professionally registered public health consultant working within public health England) may, for the purposes of screening, assessment and the imposition of any restrictions or requirements under impose on a person a requirement to be detained for 48 hours, or as long as it takes for any screening requirements and the assessment under Regulation 5 to be complied with. So this initial detention for screening purpose might be 48 hours, but it could be longer.
While the emergency Regulations have been described by Government as designed “ to make it easier for health professionals to do their jobs ”, it could be Matt Hancock making the diagnosis as to whether detention is required. Indeed, under the Regulations there is no reason in principle why a person could not be detained in circumstances where health professionals determined that the test for detention was not met, but where a Minister disagreed with that expert medical assessment.
Detention is subject to the existence of one of two conditions – A or B: Condition A is that the Secretary of State or the registered public health consultant has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is, or may be, infected or contaminated with Coronavirus and considers that there is a risk that they might infect or contaminate others. There is no reference to them having recently travelled to England. This appears, therefore, to fall within the ‘domestic’ section of the 1984 Act – section 45C. Condition B is linked to travel, and therefore appears to fall within section 45B of the Act: the person has arrived in England on an aircraft, ship or train from outside the UK (including via one of the other countries in the UK) and has left or the Secretary of State/public health consultant has reasonable grounds to believe has left an infected area within 14 days of their arrival in England.
If Condition A or B is satisfied then this entitles the Secretary of State or the consultant to impose more screening requirements or carry out an assessment of the person: Regulation 5(1)(a) and (b).
However, the existence of one of those conditions also engages an extraordinarily wide power, because the Secretary of State/the consultant may
following such an assessment, (orally or in writing) impose on or in relation to P [the person] any other restriction or requirement which the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, a registered public health consultant considers necessary for the purposes of removing or reducing the risk [of onward infection/contamination], including a special restriction or requirement.
A “ special restriction or requirement ” is defined as including one contained in section 45G(2) of the 1984 Act and which can be imposed by a justice of the peace, including detention or isolation. This might appear to be in direct conflict with the enabling legislation, although as David Lawson points out, the Regulations probably rely on the distinction in section 45D(5) between “ actually imposing quarantine and enabling a decision which imposes quarantine – the regulations allow quarantine to be imposed and do not directly impose it .”
Another far-reaching power is found at : where Condition A or B is met, further requirements may be imposed where considered necessary or proportionate. Some of those measures are fairly innocuous, for example, providing contact details to a public health officer. But they also include a requirement to “ comply with any other specified condition or to take any other specified measure”.
Isolation is addressed separately at . Again, where Condition A or Condition B is satisfied, the Secretary of State or a public health consultant may require P to be kept in isolation where they have reasonable grounds to believe that P is or may be infected or contaminated with Coronavirus, and considers that it is necessary and proportionate to isolate them in order to reduce or remove the infection/contamination risk. P is provided with the vague reassurance that “ the Secretary of State must have due regard to P’s well-being.”
There are further powers for police officers ( ), including to send and keep people in hospital “ or other suitable place ” (not defined). Here, neither condition A or B needs to be satisfied. It is enough that the constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that P “ is, or may be, infected with Coronavirus… there is a risk that P might infect or contaminate others” and “it is necessary to direct, remove or detain P in the interests of P, for the protection of other persons or for the maintenance of public safety.”
Again, these police powers – insofar as they apply outside the international travel context – appear to involve the exercise of powers envisaged under section 45G(2)(a) to (d), which are expressly excluded from the requirements that regulations can directly impose in the domestic context, and so the Government would presumably rely again on the distinction between imposing a requirement and enabling someone else to impose it.
Conclusions
One would expect that case-by-case detentions or isolations might generate judicial review challenges as to their proportionality. And Regulation 5(4) appears to envisage the detention of children, which could present its own issues in individual cases.
There might also be a difficulty in the Secretary of State’s adoption of two apparently contradictory positions when enacting the Regulations. On the one hand, he issued a that
the incidence or transmission of Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and that the incidence or transmission of Coronavirus is at such a point that the measures outlined in these Regulations may reasonably be considered as an effective means of preventing the further, significant transmission of Coronavirus .
This form of words was necessary in order to enable the imposition of special restrictions or requirements: section 45D(4)(a), 1984 Act.
Yet on the same day he that:
Clinical advice has not changed about the risk to the public, which remains moderate. We are taking a belt and braces approach to all necessary precautions to ensure public safety .
Can the threat to public health be serious, imminent and moderate all at the same time? That dichotomy could raise questions as to whether the exercise of powers of isolation and detention are rational. “ Belt and braces ” is hard to square with the language of reasonable necessity adopted by the courts when assessing proportionality. Section 45D(4) places restrictions on the power to make regulations under section 45C: “ Regulations under section 45C may not include provision enabling the imposition of a special restriction or requirement unless (a) the regulations are made in response to a serious and imminent threat to public health, or (b) the imposition of the restriction or requirement is expressed to be contingent on there being such a threat ay the time when it is imposed.”
These Regulations are effective now not only despite the Secretary of State describing the risk as moderate, but also despite the UK Chief Medical Officers agreeing with that assessment and adding “ But the risk to individuals remains low.”
And the language used in introducing these measures suggests a relaxed approach to legality: the Department of Health described the announcement of “ serious and imminent threat ” as “ a legal term … as part of changes to make it easier for health professionals to do their job.” This might suggest that the reference to a “ serious and imminent threat to public health ” is little more than an artificial work-around.
Why get hung up on the legal niceties?
Well, aside from the importance of the Rule of Law, there is a practical consequence of subordinate legislation being ultra vires : as Lord Irvine explained in [1999] 2 AC 143 at 158, it means that the legislation “ is unlawful simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction, is of no legal effect whatsoever ”.

Beautiful girl jumped through the window to hide quarantine corona indignation. 	"The two girls from Russia were quarantined on suspicion of being infected with corona virus but fled with their claims that the doctors abandoned them and the shabby hospital conditions they were kept in isolation. Russian woman jumped out of the window to hide quarantine corona
Accidentally condemned by the public for jumping over the corona quarantine window after returning from China, a woman named Guzel Neder voiced his accountability.
Neder was the one who jumped out the window to escape from the hospital, while another patient escaped by breaking the lock on the room.
Guzel Neder said she tested positive for corona virus but was kept and isolated for 2 weeks.
Both men said they fled the hospital earlier this month because the doctors abandoned them and the poor conditions in the hospital made them fear they would be infected.
In an Instagram post, Neder shared that she decided to leave the hospital after being informed of the positive corona virus test result after 5 days of isolation in the hospital.
She also denied that her son - who with her escaped from the hospital - was infected with the corona virus. She admitted to calling an ambulance for her son after returning from China because she had a fever but her test results were positive for corona virus. She took her child to escape from the hospital after 5 days of isolation because of poor hygiene standards here.
Russian woman Guzel Neder has been to Hainan Island, China in the context of the corona epidemic raging in China.
Neder also confirmed that she went to China’s Hainan Island, not the Wuhan corona center.
Hainan Island, a tropical region of China, is very popular with Russian tourists.
Only two cases of corona virus infection have been confirmed in Russia, but health authorities have taken drastic steps to prevent new infections, including requiring hospitalization to quarantine hundreds of people recently. returning from China just in case.
Another woman who escaped from the isolation room was Alla Ilyina. In an Instagram post, Ilyina said she had a sore throat a few days after returning to St Petersburg from Hainan Island and was taken to the hospital for corona virus testing.
Although I tested negative for corona virus and was asked how to do it, Ilyina still escaped from the hospital because there were no books, no shampoo, no Wi-Fi, no floors, the floor was not cleaned ...
Ilyina also said that she successfully unlocked the electric lock and neither the police nor the hospital contacted her afterwards.
""If I was really sick, they contacted me by phone,"" Ilyina said."
Chinese Corona Virus, Spanish Flu, German Measles. 	"It's the first sign of Spring, even before the first crocii peep their heads above the snow. I'm talking about the olde government fear tactic of scaring the Sheeple by raising the tried and true ancient boogyman of e pidemic s. In spite of all the progress of modern medicine, have you ever noticed how, when they drag these old tactics out, they always associate them with the same country that the hegemon is trying to vilify? Just a coinkydynk, I suppose.

Interspersed into the (((media))) headlines about the trade wars and the extradition wars--we now have headlines about a terrible virus that is jumping international borders and...wait for it...so far has made all of SEVEN people sick!
Hey, you can't have all those highly paid ""scientists"" in those bioweapons labs/CDC/WHO agencies all over the West just sitting twiddling their thumbs. You need to annually task them with coming up with plagues...like in the Old Testament...to terrorize the sheeple into submission. When the UK was fighting Spain they had the Spanish flu. They also called syphilis ""the Spanish Disease"". When the ""allies"" were fighting the Germans...we had ""German measles"". Now, when we're trying to save our hegemonic economy from challenging nations like China...we have the Wuhun virus:
A mystery virus - previously unknown to science - is causing severe lung disease in the Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 50 people have been infected. Seven are currently in a critical condition.

Trump Proposes Massive Tariff on Chinese Corona Virus. 	"This is the “Mother of all Corona-Viruses, so they’ll just have to spread it to some other country This is the Virus. Please Mr. Trump Save our Country
President Trump was furious when he found out that the deadly Corona virus originated in China and has spread to the United States in 2 confirmed cases said CDC spokesperson William “Bill” Fold. Reports are that these “victims” have had some headaches and sniffles, maybe a low-grade fever, but aren’t really that sick. No big deal really.
“It looks like they’ve taken one of our Patented viruses and done something to it and it mutated into God knows what.” Mr. Fold said today in a telephone interview from Washington D.C. “Those guys are always copying our stuff and turning it in to garbage.”
Trump vows to keep it out of the country by imposing a massive tariff on the virus. This is the “Mother of all Corona-Viruses, so they’ll just have to spread it to some other country because we are all full. If that means more tariffs, well then that is our position.”
“Our country is full, we can’t take any more viruses and if China won’t stop it I will.” the President said today from Mar-a-Lago Resort where he was relaxing from his busy schedule working, 18 to 20 hours a day.
“President Xi assured me that he was closing down Wu Tang Clan, which is a very populated area.

Baseball School Hit by Most Intense Venezuelan Covid-19 Outbreak. 	"A baseball academy that recently produced prospects for U.S. teams including the Yankees and the White Sox is ground zero for the most intense outbreak of the coronavirus in Venezuela.
The disease took hold after two players from the Roberto Vahlis Academy on Margarita Island returned from the Dominican Republic last month, unaware that they were infected, according to the government.
Margarita, known for beach vacations and kite surfing, now accounts for about a quarter of Venezuela’s confirmed cases and the highest number of infections outside Caracas.
The government of President Nicolas Maduro responded by arresting two of the academy’s managers, a coach and a doctor. Epidemiologist Carmen Hernandez, who works for the opposition-led state government, was also detained. They were all accused of refusing to provide information on the victims’ health status to the government.
“I hope this outbreak will come to an end soon, that we can contact all infected people, give them their respective treatment and guarantee their prompt recovery,” Maduro said Wednesday after reporting eight new cases in the region.
Seventy of Venezuela’s 298 confirmed cases of the disease are directly connected to the academy, according to the government.
Outbreak, Crackdown
Hernadez’s lawyer, Argenis Rodriguez, said by phone that the accusation is false and that her client could face up to six years in prison despite never visiting the academy.
The family of a prospect recently signed by the the Philadelphia Phillies, are among those being monitored for the virus, Maduro said. Although Maduro didn’t name him, the Phillies last month signed outfielder Yhoswar Garcia from the academy.
Maduro didn’t say that either the player or his family are sick. The Phillies didn’t immediately reply to a written request for comment.
In 2018, academy players Edgar Navarro and Jesus Rondon signed as rookie pitchers for the White Sox’s Dominican Summer League, while Ismael Gomez signed as a rookie pitcher for the Gulf Coast League of the New York Yankees.
Venezuelans are well represented on U.S. major league teams, and it used to be common for them to play in their home country’s league during the off-season. Last year, Major League Baseball barred players from participating in the Venezuelan Winter League, due to sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump.
This week, the military banned local residents from leaving their homes after 4 p.m., threatening those who don’t comply with bio-terrorism charges.
The government is using the outbreak as a pretext to crack down on political opponents, said Alfredo Romero, director of the human rights NGO Penal Forum. The authorities have detained almost 70 people for political reasons, including doctors, lab workers and journalists, Romero said.

Caretaker of dying COVID-19 patient steals her ring and credit cards, CO officials say. 	"A Colorado woman was charged with theft of an at-risk senior after allegedly pawning a dying coronavirus patient's engagement ring and stealing her credit card, the Denver District Attorney said.
Elizabeth Daniels, a 29-year-old from Aurora, Colorado, was providing care to an 86-year-old woman, who died of COVID-19, according to a news release from the Denver DA.
Daniels allegedly stole and pawned her patient's diamond engagement ring days before her death, according to the DA. Daniels also is accused of stealing the woman's credit card, which was used to make purchases on the same day she died, the news release said.
""As (her) family was making arrangements with the funeral home, they became aware of the alleged theft and reported it to the Denver Police Department,"" the news release said. ""Detectives assigned to investigate secured the arrest affidavit for Daniels the same day.""
Daniels was hired at Carillon at Belleview Station , a senior living center in Denver, as a temporary employee because the center was ""experiencing a high number of COVID-19 cases,"" according to The Denver Post. The center has 30 confirmed coronavirus cases and six resident deaths as of April 22, according to the news outlet.
The patient's daughter-in-law told police that she noticed transactions on several credit cards after her mother-in-law had died, according to The Denver Channel. Among the charges was a $200 credit card charge from an auto shop, where an employee confirmed Daniels had made the charge, the news outlet reported.
A pawn shop also identified Daniels as the person who pawned the ring, The Denver Channel reported.
Daniels was charged with theft from an at-risk person, identity theft, providing a false statement to a pawnbroker and criminal possession of a financial transaction device, according to the Denver District Attorney."
Kerala CM seeks PM's intervention to bring back bodies of NRIs from Gulf who didn't die of Covid-19. 	"Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in bringing back bodies of those Keralites who died in Gulf countries of reasons other than COVID-19 infection.""I would like to draw your attention to the grievances received from Non-resident Keralites Associations (NRKs) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries on the delay caused in bringing home the mortal remains of NRKs who had expired due to reasons other than the COVID-19 infection,"" read the letter by the CM.
""It is learnt that a 'clearance certificate' from the Indian Embassies is required to process the application of bringing home the mortal remains of the dead. The Embassies are insisting on the production of a no-objection certificate from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), New Delhi,"" it read.
The letter also mentions that the government of India has already agreed that the mortal remains, in cases where the deaths are not due to COVID-19 infection such certificates are not necessary. And the mortal remains are brought in the cargo planes.
""To enable to bring back the bodies of the NRIs whose deaths occurred due to reasons other than COVID-19 infection, without necessary procedural hassles, I request your kind intervention,"" read the letter further.

Corona Virus Spreading. 	"These viruses were discovered in the1960s, where the earliest ones were infectious bronchitis viruses in chickens.
THE Corona virus has been spreading rapidly across China despite intense measures to contain it. This is largely due to the ability of people to move easily form one place to another as well as to the ability of the virus to be transmitted during the incubation period. Corona viruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
These viruses were discovered in the1960s, where the earliest ones were infectious bronchitis viruses in chickens.
The virus in its current form infects the respiratory tract and causes pneumonia.
To date 17390 cases have been reported with over 362 deaths worldwide. However, this number is steadily increasing. The virus has made its way across the world, with one death reported in the Philippines. China is steadily adding that more cases. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, said that 5 million people had left the city before travel restrictions were imposed ahead of the Chinese New Year. Since then, the Chinese authorities have confirmed that it will refurbish and re-open the Xiaotangshan Hospital on the outskirts of Beijing.
The government has also placed 56 million people in Wuhan and the surrounding provinces under quarantine.
Health officials in South Africa said that no corona virus infections have been reported in Africa so far. South African Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, added that all points of entry have been upgraded with improved screening tools.
Gauteng Health has selected three public hospitals as emergency centres for the virus.
These are the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, the Steve Biko Academic Hospital and the Tembisa Hospital.
According to the Centre for Disease Control, common human corona virus symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and a general feeling of being unwell.
To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention or the treatment of the Corona virus.

Corona Virus Preventive Homeopathic Medicines. 	"First things first, just to remind everybody this is a VIRUS, not a bacterial infection. Viruses only respond to our immune system, so taking an unnecessary course of antibiotics WILL NOT help, but can actually harm - as antibiotics can lower your immune response by affecting the stomach!
The following tips are also helpful as the world enters the (normal) flu season!!
Start taking:
High levels of Vitamin C – FOODS HIGH IN VIT C – Thyme, cabbage, parsley, onions, lemons, limes, and oranges.
ZINC -FOODS HIGH IN ZINC – Ginger, Pumpkin Seeds, Lentils.
Vitamin D3 - get out into the sun!!
Probiotics (multi-strain) – Manuka Honey – 2 tsp a day – one teaspoon in the morning and one teaspoon at night.
Essential oils - EOs are excellent to start burning in your room and in your homes!! Our first point of contact for viruses is our nose. If you are burning antiviral essential oils around you this will kill off the virus before it enters your system."
Mount Sinai Researchers Collaborate with GenScript to Develop a COVID-19 Antibody to Treat Sick Patients. 	"NEW YORK (PRWEB)April 23, 2020 A team of researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in collaboration with GenScript, is developing a synthetic antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This antibody is intended to block the virus from entering human lung cells, and would be another potential treatment option for COVID-19.
The efforts are being led by Mone Zaidi, MD, PhD, MACP, Director of the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Professor of Medicine (Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Tony Yuen, PhD, Associate Director for Research for the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have many protein ""spikes"" protruding from their outer surface. A specific region of the ""spike"" called the S1 protein binds to a molecule called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2, which is found on the surface of many human cells, including those in the lungs. This is the entry point by which the virus infects a person.
In hopes of developing a treatment that could block the viral entry into cells, Dr. Zaidi and his team, including Sakshi Gera, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are creating an antibody targeted to a peptide sequence of the S1 spike protein that should interfere with, and thereby block, the virus and prevent its initial attachment and entry into human cells.
The artificial blocking antibody then could be given to people with COVID-19 to stop the virus from infecting additional cells, much as doctors are already doing with natural antibodies harvested from people who have survived COVID-19, in what is known as convalescent plasma therapy.
""Given that convalescent plasma is showing promise and potential in treating this novel virus, the same strategy should be adopted for treatment in sick patients by creating a targeted antibody, which we hope will have the ability to disengage and block COVID-19 from entering our cells. Having experience with antibody development, my lab has embarked on this task together with the generous support of GenScript,"" said Dr. Zaidi.
The first step, now underway, is to create a custom version of the S1 spike's peptide sequence, which will be used to generate the antibody. Once the peptide sequence is available, Dr. Zaidi's team will collaborate with GenScript to generate a human antibody which will be tested for efficacy in human cells in culture and animal models. Dr. Zaidi and his team hope to then collaborate with Mount Sinai's Department of Microbiology for further antibody testing. ""It's hard to project how long it will take to have something we can test in patients, but my aim is to have a targeted antibody for first human trials within the next 12 months if all goes as planned, but it could be earlier,"" said Dr. Zaidi.
""GenScript's collaboration with Dr. Zaidi's lab to co-develop a COVID-19 antibody program signifies GenScript's ongoing commitment to work with scientific communities to annihilate and prevent COVID-19 beyond its business model. We expect that GenScript's antibody discovery and development expertise, especially in the field of COVID-19, will fuel Mount Sinai's first-rate research and development capabilities to bring this important medication to patients,"" said Kenneth Lee, Head of US Commercial Division at GenScript ProBio.

Google search trends reveal people confusing coronavirus with Corona beer. 	"With the widespread outbreak of coronavirus in China's Wuhan city, people over the globe are confusing the deadly disease with the famous corona beer.
According to Fox News, the latest Google trends statistics reflect that searches for ""corona beer virus"" have seen a considerable spike in the recent days.
This made it quite apparent that people are confusing between the coronavirus disease and the popular beer brand Corona .
The eastern European nation of Estonia currently leads the pack for ""corona beer virus"" searches with marked surges seen across all the continents.
Fortunately, a gentleman named Realeboga Mashiane shined some light over this epidemic of ignorance by tweeting an image that clearly illustrated the difference between the two coronas.

Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected Patients. 	"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (“S-Trimer”) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag © technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.
“I am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses”.
“We are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.”

About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
The new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus."

CORONA VIRUS: RAINING CATS AND DOGS IN CHINESE PLAGUE CITY. 	Shocking photos circulating on the internet appear to show a new, disturbing trend in the disease stricken city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the corona virus outbreak. Many pet owners now appear to be killing their pets as a measure to prevent infection from the virus, which is thought to be carried by cats and dogs in addition to other smaller mammals like bats. Even worse -- as many residents in the 12-million-people city live in high rise apartment blocks -- they are simply throwing their pets out of windows and off balconies to land on the streets below where many pets are killed and injured. The above photo shows where several pets have landed and are either dead or are dying, like this poor dog, which was until recently somome's loved and overfed pet. Meanwhile other dog owners, out walking their pets, faced with this spectacle, are being forced to think about the potential danger their pets pose to the family and consider whether they too will have to take such drastic action.
AMERICAN FLU MORE BIGGER THAN CORONA VIRUS. 	Democracy Dies in Darkness Health Get a grippe, America. The flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus, for now. Certified medical assistant Wendy Kerley gives Ethan Getman, 15, a shot of the flu vaccine in Memphis. (Jim Weber/Daily Memphian/AP) By Lenny Bernstein February 1, 2020 at 8:00 AM EST The rapidly spreading virus has closed schools in Knoxville, Tenn., cut blood donations to dangerous levels in Cleveland and prompted limits on hospital visitors in Wilson, N.C. More ominously, it has infected as many as 26 million people in the United States in just four months, killing up to 25,000 so far. In other words, a difficult but not extraordinary flu season in the United States, the kind most people shrug off each winter or handle with rest, fluids and pain relievers if they contract the illness. But this year, a new coronavirus from China has focused attention on diseases that can sweep through an entire population, rattling the public despite the current magnitude of the threat. Clearly, the flu poses the bigger and more pressing peril; a handful of cases of the new respiratory illness have been reported in the United States, none of them fatal or apparently even life-threatening. “Anything that we don’t feel we have sufficient information about feels like a threat,” said Lynn Bufka, senior director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association and an expert on anxiety. “The flu doesn’t feel novel. Most people’s experience with the flu is they’ve had it, they’ve recovered, it’s not a big deal — despite the fact that thousands of people die every year.” ( and /The Washington Post) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8.6 million to 12 million people have visited health-care providers complaining of influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, coughing, sneezing and aches since the flu season began Oct. 1. As many as 310,000 have been hospitalized, and 68 children have died. On the CDC’s map of flu activity, most of the nation is a deep red, indicating the highest level of “influenza-like illness” activity. The entire school district serving Knoxville and Knox County, Tenn., which has 57,800 students, shut down this past week because of flu circulating among students and staff. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, 218 people have died and 2,500 have shown up in emergency rooms in the city alone, said Merle Gordon, director of the city’s Department of Public Health. In Arkansas, nine school districts are closed, 33 people have died and hospitalizations have increased sharply in the past two weeks. “We’re being hit right now, a lot of communities at the same time,” said Jennifer Dillaha, medical director for immunizations and outbreak response for the Arkansas Department of Health. More than 173 million doses of flu vaccine have been administered to date, much less than needed to cover the nation. During the 2018-2019 flu season, the latest with complete data available, just 45.3 percent of adults and 62.6 percent of children received flu shots, according to the CDC. Two types of flu are circulating , increasing risk. They seem to be producing fewer fatalities among older people, who typically comprise most of the deaths during flu season, but they are hitting children hard. The current season does not appear to be as severe as 2017-2018, when the flu reached epidemic proportions and as many as 95,000 people died, according to CDC estimates. But no amount of flu can mitigate public fear and interest in the new coronavirus, which is spreading inexorably out of China, where it has killed more than 200 people and infected more than 11,000. “I would say that there’s good interest in both,” Dillaha said. “I think people are a little bit panicked about coronavirus and want to know what steps to take, thinking that it’s circulating in the state.” So far, it isn’t, she said. “Any time someone asks about the flu, they talk about coronavirus, and any time they talk coronavirus, they ask about the flu,” she said. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the government task force coordinating the response to the coronavirus, said he is often asked why the government is focusing on coronavirus when so many are dying of seasonal influenza. “I often get asked: ‘We have an influenza outbreak here, we have about 8,000 deaths already, 100,000 hospitalizations. Why are we paying such attention’ ” to coronavirus? “The reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty of seasonal flu. I can tell you as we get into March and April, the cases are going to go down.” Until officials can offer that kind of certainty about the coronavirus, even if it does not seem as dangerous as the flu, anxiety levels will not decline, Bufka said. While public health officials are urging handwashing, staying home when sick and keeping a distance from obviously ill people, Bufka suggests a different calculation for mental health. When she counsels anxious clients, they “try to get a good assessment of what is actually the risk,” she said. “How likely is it? And try to distinguish between possibility and probability. “Sure, it’s possible there will be more cases in the U.S. It’s probable there will be more cases in the U.S. But it’s not likely to be the person standing next to me in the grocery store.” U.S. to deny entry to foreign nationals who recently visited China Unprecedented Chinese quarantine could backfire, experts say U.S. reports first person-to-person transmission of coronavirus
Can the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) be spread by people. 	"Can the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) be spread by people without symptoms?
It's been a controversial question ever since a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) last week claimed that a woman who was ""asymptomatic"" triggered a chain of infections near Munich.
It was a surprising observation because coronaviruses are believed to be spread primarily by people who are already sick, through droplets generated by coughing and sneezing.
The original report said the woman did not show symptoms until later.
""During her stay, she had been well with no sign or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China,"" the authors wrote.
Because the report was published in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, it immediately raised questions about how to manage people exposed to the virus.
But the report was wrong.
By the numbers: Coronavirus outbreak charted The case study was based on faulty information because the original authors did not speak directly to the patient, according to a news report in the journal Science .
The NEJM report was signed by 17 doctors from several German hospitals and research institutes. The Science article Quote: s one author, Michael Hoelscher of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Medical Centre, who said the information about the asymptomatic visitor came from the infected German patients.
Since then, German health officials have spoken directly with the woman from Shanghai. She told them she was already feeling ill when she met with German colleagues near Munich.
The woman had ""mild, unspecific symptoms"" while in Germany and took medication to reduce a fever, said Marieke Degen, a spokesperson for Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), in an email to CBC News.
So far, at least 10 German people including two children have coronavirus (2019-nCOV) infections linked to that business meeting at the Webasto automotive supply company two weeks ago.
Widely cited The original NEJM report was cited by prominent public health officials as they made decisions about how to handle people potentially exposed to the virus.
On Friday, the U.S. Centers For Disease Control (CDC) held a news conference to outline the quarantine plan for Americans who had been flown home from China.
""While we still don't have the full picture and we can't predict how this situation will play out in the U.S., the current situation, the current scenario, is a cause for concern,"" said CDC spokesperson Dr. Nancy Messonnier, citing the NEJM report.
Second Opinion: 'We're opening everything': Scientists share coronavirus data in unprecedented way to contain, treat disease Despite that initial report, infectious disease experts continued to insist that most of the risk of infection comes from people who are coughing and sneezing, and already feeling ill.
Asymptomatic vs. 'subclinical' Still, the case study raised questions.
""Many of us were open-minded about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, but also many of us believe that it's just more likely that symptomatic people would be transmitting the infection,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto's University Health Network.
The question of asymptomatic spread is still controversial even though this prominent case study was wrong.
There is evidence that people can be infected and show no symptoms. And there are people who have a mild illness and might not seek out medical attention, but will still be able to spread the virus, said Bogoch.
Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto's University Health Network, says mistakes happen, but it's important to be accurate when describing conditions such as 'asymptomatic' disease. (Craig Chivers/CBC) Bogoch prefers the term subclinical. ""These are people who have a range of symptoms ranging from zero symptoms to overt symptoms but the symptoms aren't severe enough such that they seek medical care.""
Subclinical infections are important because there's a risk that people who are still well enough to go to work and circulate in the community will drive the epidemic, he said.
'Mistakes happen' Scientists and medical journals around the world have committed to sharing information about the coronavirus quickly and openly during this epidemic to help contain and treat the disease. But that rapid turnaround time increases the risk of errors.
""We're balancing getting as much information out as fast as possible to help with this, but of course, we also have to be careful,"" said Bogoch.
""Mistakes happen. Just acknowledge and correct the mistakes.""
So far, the NEJM has not retracted the article.
""We're working on it but we're not yet in a position to make a statement or answer additional questions,"" the journal told CBC News in an email."
New therapy tested on COVID-19 patients. 	"""My experience was extremely mild. It felt like, maybe a flu. I had a fever for 24 hours. That was about it,"" Lee Williams said, describing his COVID-19 symptoms.
He is hoping for a positive outcome from his experience with the virus.
On Thursday, he donated his plasma at Vitalant blood bank, in the hopes his immune system will give others a fighting chance.
""Whenever you get COVID-19 your body produces anti-bodies that can help fight that infection off,"" Brandon Baker, senior recruitment manager at Vitalant, said.
Those anti-bodies can be contained in what&apos;s called ""convalescent serum"" or plasma from people who have recovered.
This new therapy injects the serum into patients, currently battling the virus.
""It&apos;s just kind of an extra boost to a patient&apos;s immune system,"" Baker said.
This method has been used in the past to treat Ebola, SARS and even patients of the 1918 flu pandemic.
""So the idea goes way back, and there is some success. there&apos;s no guarantees on this. We don&apos;t even know how well these antibodies will kill the virus or what quantities they need to be, but considering there are no other treatments, this is great opportunity to see if this will help,"" Dr. Steven Berk, Dean of Medicine at Texas Tech Health Science Center, said.
UMC has already begun using the procedure on critically ill patients.
""Initial results are very positive. And it has shown that it has lessened symptoms and helped to shorten hospital stays,"" Baker said.
As the number of recovered cases continues to grow, so will the need to replenish supply of antibodies for treatment.
Doctors are urging people who have beaten the virus to pay it forward.
""I feel like it&apos;s important to donate plasma, just to help other people. Hopefully others who have worse symptoms than me... to be able to live,"" Williams said.
The therapy is considered relatively safe, but is not a cure for the disease.
""What we&apos;d like to do is vaccine an entire population. And then this will go away, like polio went away,"" Dr. Berk said.
Experts say it could be months before a vaccine is developed."
It's irresponsible and it's dangerous': Experts rip Trump's idea of injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19. 	"President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested exploring disinfectants as a possible treatment for coronavirus infections - an extremely dangerous proposition that medical experts warn could kill people.
After a Homeland Security official mentioned the ability of disinfectants like bleach to kill the coronavirus on surfaces, Trump remarked on the effectiveness.
""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"" Trump said during his daily briefing at the White House. ""Because, you see, it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So that you're going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds - it sounds interesting to me.""
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
Disinfectants like bleach are poisonous and dangerous when mishandled, doctors say.
""This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible, and it's dangerous,"" said Dr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist and global health policy expert who is an NBC News and MSNBC contributor. ""It's a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves.""
Trump's Food and Drug Administration specifically warned against drinking the chemicals in disinfectants ­- a fake science that has been peddled as a cure for autism and HIV infection for decades - noting that consumption of such products ""can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration.""
""Any amount of bleach or isopropyl alcohol or any kind of common household cleaner is inappropriate for ingestion even in small amounts. Small amounts are deadly,"" Gupta said.
Online, others doctors reacted with horror.
Gupta added that it was ""demoralizing"" for a doctor to hear the White House ""peddle improper health messaging"" and said the president had a pattern of pushing unproven medical treatments.
The president spent weeks advocating to use the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine after anecdotal evidence suggested that it might help patients fight COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus. On Tuesday, a study of coronavirus patients in a Veterans Affairs hospital reported more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than among those treated with standard care.
""It's exceptionally dangerous,"" Gupta said. ""There's people who hang on to every word of the president.""
The claim came after a long exchange in which Trump also suggested that light and heat - which also can destroy the coronavirus on a surface - be used to cure the disease.
""Maybe you can. Maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. I'm, like, a person who has a good you-know-what,"" Trump said, pointing to his head.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said she had not seen heat and light used as ""a treatment.""
Joe Biden, the apparent Democratic presidential nominee, criticized Trump for the suggestions on Twitter.
""Here's an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals,"" he said."
Corona Woman Kamikaze. 	"Chinese woman deliberately hides her symptoms to sneak a strain of corona virus into France, then brags about it on social media and immediately gets caught.
My only comment here is that, to me, signalling her actions and getting caught was all apart of a plan.
Some are saying the corona virus is being used as a distraction from growing public awareness and resentment toward the New World Order and their world leader cronies impeding justice. That isn't to say it isn't real; by all means, a real bioweapon was just discharged across several continents. But to say it's just China doing China things? No way, it's never that simple."
Wuhan Corona Virus Plus. 	"Nature Briefing (1.27.2020) recommended this short video (2m 28s) on the Wuhan corona virus, which highlights key things to know about the outbreak, and how science can help control it.
This interview with structural biologist Rolf Hilgenfield who has been working on corona viruses since the 2002-2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Virus) outbreak provides a scientific perspective on the virus. It is a 4-minute read .
A quote from the interview provides a perspective, one you may find chilling, on the prospects of the development of drugs to treat the most recent outbreak. "" And the total number of people infected, if you combine SARS, MERS and this new virus, is under 12,500 people. That’s not a market. The number of cases is too small. Pharmaceutical companies are not interested .""
Hilgenfield hopes to get into to Wuhan to work with researchers to test the efficacy of two early stage compounds in infected animals. These are not yet ready for human-use.
Eleanor Klibanoff (NPR) provides a short history of quarantines, from the bubonic plague to Typhoid Mary to Ebola. The question for all of us is if we were the public health official in charge of making such a decision would we and for what reason. It is fair to ask whether you'd like to have more information. If so, what information?

Indore: Two students admitted to MYH isolation ward on suspicion of corona virus. 	"Two Indian students who had returned from China were admitted to isolation ward of MY hospital on Friday with suspected Coronavirus infection after they developed cold-like symptoms .
According to hospital sources, both the students were pursuing medical course in Chinese cities where spread of Coronavirus has been reported. They reached India on January 15, but developed symptoms later.
The boy, 21, of Khargone was studying in a medical university in Nanchang province and the girl, 22, a resident of Indore was student in Wuhan province .
MY superintendent PS Thakur said that both the students had been put under observation in an isolated ward. ""We have been sending their blood and swab samples to NIBM, Pune for testing. We can give further details about them only after receiving their reports,"" he said.
The ward has been set up at chest centre behind the main building and TB patients have been shifted from there. ""We have all kind of facilities to treat it and have arranged over 50 beds for such patient,"" said Thakur.
Divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi said, ""There is no need to panic because of Coronavirus. The two patients admitted to MY hospital are under observation and stable.""

Migratory ducks should be spared to avoid corona virus chances. 	Shortly duck hunting season would commence in Chitral and ponds and lakes by the river would be prepared as a ploy to lure the unwary migratory ducks to fall for this foul cheating and thereafter the ruthless massacre by the ‘peaceful’ people of Chitral. This year however the ducks have a chance. As corona virus is a product of China and much of these birds come from Siberia and China, it is therefore worthwhile to exercise caution and not kill these ducks at least this season to preclude any possibility of contracting the virus from contaminated migratory ducks. The clerics in mosques and the district administration can play their role to dissuade compulsive duck shooters to abstain, and thereby earn Allah’s mercy for themselves.

Stratasys and Origin Partner to Bring Millions of 3D-Printed Nasopharyngeal Swabs to Healthcare Providers for COVID-19 Testing. 	"Origin plans to increase production from 100,000 per week to over a million per week by May EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- In response to the pressing need for more COVID-19 testing, Stratasys, Inc. and Origin have signed an agreement in which Stratasys will market and promote Origin 3D-printed nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs to healthcare providers and other testing centers in the U.S.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200423005604/en/
As widely reported, widespread testing of millions of people is currently hampered by a shortage of testing supplies. Each Origin One 3D printer has the ability to produce batches of 1,500 Origin NP O1 Swabs at a time, multiple times daily. Origin is moving towards a streamlined process allowing the production of approximately 190,000 per day, or 1.3 million per week.
Stratasys will leverage its position as a leading provider of 3D printing solutions to the healthcare industry to market Origin NP O1 Swabs. Stratasys has already been actively serving healthcare systems across the country during the pandemic by leading a coalition that has been providing 3D-printed face shields to nearly 100 front-line organizations. To date, the coalition has provided about 40,000 shields at no cost to health systems.
Stratasys Americas President Rich Garrity said Stratasys is ready to help get millions of swabs to wherever they are most needed. ""We have tremendous confidence in Origin's 3D printing technology, and we're confident in our ability to help bring them to market efficiently,"" he said.
Origin CEO, Christopher Prucha said Origin is ready to scale quickly. ""We believe widespread testing can help save lives and get our economy going again, and we're confident that our Origin One technology and simple material requirements will be able to produce millions of swabs to meet the need,"" he said. ""We've been impressed by the speed with which Stratasys has been able to provide thousands of shields to healthcare systems across the country and believe they are the right partner for helping get millions of swabs where they are most needed.""
Origin swabs were tested in a clinical trial with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an academic medical center affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Origin reports that results show Origin swabs performed the highest with regard to concordance to control swabs compared to two other 3D printed swabs. In addition, in subjective feedback, Origin swabs were preferred over the other 3D printed swabs.
Each Origin NP O1 Swab is autoclavable and individually packaged. More information is available at www.stratasys.com/covid-19 , along with other information about how Stratasys is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Teicoplanin potently blocks the cell entry of 2019-nCoV. 	Since December 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has greatly threatened the public health in China and raised great concerns worldwide. No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 μM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.

No - We Do Not Have The Corona Virus - Home From China. 	"No - We Do Not Have The Corona Virus - Home From China Harry is home from six months in China. We returned home from China on January 15th. We had a wonderful six months there - and were home ready to continue onto the next adventure. But the last two weeks have been sort of a let down. After all that excitement and the Corona Virus thing - we are relieved that we dodged the bullet physically. But the mental let down has left me with writer's block - and an extreme sadness for the Chinese people. I have to start this story in 1998. I had prostate cancer and had my prostate removed. If you have had cancer - you know the scare of staring the grim reaper in the face - it is not pretty. Lulu insisted that I have my surgery at Sloan Kettering in New York City - the best. They took a full body x-ray to see if the cancer spread to other parts of my body. That proved extremely important later on. I had my prostate removed and life went on. In 2003 - I retired from teaching. Just as I was ready to celebrate retirement - during a routine lung x-ray - a spot appeared on my lung. It was an up and down roller coaster - from the highest high to the lowest low. We had more tests and waited weeks which seemed like years for the results. The results were a 1 cm circular nodule on the upper right lung - a daughter cell from my former cancer I thought. It looked like my retirement would be very short. Lulu arranged a big retirement celebration for me. We went back to the doctor. He said - if only we had an old x-ray. Right away we thought of Sloan Kettering. We sent for my full body x-ray. Eureka! There is was. On the old x-ray - you could see the tiny nodule. My doctor said I probably had tuberculosis many many years ago. It was an old healed scar. Because it was perfectly round - and lasted so long - it was NOT cancer. Lulu took me here to be treated for a bacterial lung infection Flash forward to Beijing China. For Thanksgiving - our friend Melissa came to visit. We both had this horrible cough that seemed to be caused by the air pollution. We were both eating Ricola lozenges like candy. They provided some cough relief. The cough persisted - all day and night. Remember this was right before the Corona Virus scare. One day Lulu just called a cab and took me to the hospital. I coughed my way into Peking University People's Hospital. They triaged me to the Infectious Disease Clinic. I was in a waiting room of maybe 40 people. The Clinic did a blood test - chest x-ray - took my temperature and blood pressure - and then I went right in to see the doctor. She told me that I had a bacterial infection in my lung. She said it was not contagious. She said I could have an IV antibiotic or oral medication. I took the pills because I wanted to get out of there right away. All that medical treatment cost $60! I paid cash on the spot and they gave me the antibiotic right there. We went back to the apartment and I cleared right up in a few days. The doctor also noticed a spot on my lungs. She was concerned and told me to get a CT-scan once we were back in America. That should have set off a previous alarm bell from back in 2003 - but it didn't. Instead we worried - that I had some other disease. Lulu decided that we would spend Christmas with the whole family in Paris. It would provide some warm weather for me - and some much needed ""family battery recharge."" She also included a week in Spain on the Med Sea. To Lulu - Christmas does not exist without family. We returned to China in time to complete Lulu's Fulbright Scholarship. We left China on January 15th - because that was the day our Residence Visa expired. We were cutting it close and any delay would have put us in the slammer. We went from Paris to Peking to Seattle to Atlanta to Tallahassee in 48 hours. We sailed ¾ the way around the world. Because of tickets and obligations we had to take that long way home. When we got home we were greeted by the Corona Virus Scare. We were coming from China and CNN was running constant news that ""we were all gonna die."" I was carrying a spot in my lung and had to go see my doctor. Dr Hartsfield took me right away. He put my mind at ease. I bought a new thermometer and was taking my temperature every hours. I had not broken 98.1. He said - with no fever - my chances are low to having Corona. Yes - I am to the familiarity level of calling it by its first name. He scheduled an x-ray - with the memo ""recent pneumonia"" - to speed it up. When I got to the x-ray clinic - and I said I was in China for six months - they literally started spraying and holding my papers with tweezers. Even the pretty women technicians - were taking a step back from me. I have spots all over my body where they were touching me with ten foot poles! Now they had me scared. The doctor reported that he saw the spot on my lung. Uh-oh! I was already wondering how many people would show up for my funeral. He said I would have a CT-scan right away. By the time of the CT-scan - my looks must have improved - because those attendants treated me like normal - although I was in and out of there in 5 minutes. The doctor asked me if I have any old CT-scans to compare it to you. Then I remembered - the OLD x-rays from New York City - Coaldale - and Reading. I told the doctor of the x-rays and CT-scans from back when I cancer in 1998. I told the doctor I had a 1 cm circular nodule scar on my upper right lung in 2003. He said we will wait for the x-rays from up north - but he said you still have a 1 cm circular nodular scar on your upper right lung. :-) Lulu original applied to go to Wuhan University for her Fulbright Scholarship. They have the top library science school in China. But at the last minute - Fulbright decided we would go to Beijing. We wanted the Wuhan warm weather - but Beijing has so much more to see and do. We were lucky. With the Corona Virus - we would be quarantined there now. We would have been there until Jan 30th. With all the news about Corona Virus - people have been asking me how we are. It is hard to rank the best times of your life - but our China visit is easily in the Top 10. We loved our time there and love the people of China. China is such a Giant country - 1.3 billion people. They have giant problems with air pollution - water pollution - sewage disposal - and now Corona Virus. In the 70 years of the government - they have never been at war. They have made great strides in economy and production. The people have wonderful attitude and work hard. I finish this story exhausted. After six months of constant on the go - the last two weeks at home have been heaven. We appreciate the clean water and air. We love going to Sonnys BBQ for supper. Shopping at Publix for food is heavenly. Having supper 4 nights straight at 4 different friends' houses is nice. Watching 4 FSU basketball games in a week is cool. Adjusting to jet lag in your own home and bed is divine. I did not even mention I gained 5 pounds in China. Yes - I am having a little let down and writer's block. I am so the thankful for Lulu and everything I have. By the way - did I tell you - I have a 1 cm circular nodule on my upper right lung for 25 years."
Mennonite Man Totally Immune to the Corona Virus. 	"While panic is setting in around the world, one Mennonite man in Mexico is not in the least bit concerned about the Corona virus.
“I’m immune,” says Mr. Ens. “I haven’t touched the stuff in forty years. Oh, sure, my cousin Harry offered me a sip back when we were teenagers, but I never got a taste for it. I’ve got no worries.”
Local church elders were equally unperturbed about the threat.
“I know our people and I know them well,” said Elder Wall. “They’re not drinkers. The Corona virus will not infect our Mennonite communities. Oh, sure, there are a few who’ve left the colony and live in the city now. For them, maybe, it’s a problem. But here in Hochfeld! Never!”
Still, some members of the community are taking extra precautions.
“We’ve all switched to Dos Equis,” said Mr. Harder. “It tastes better anyway.”
So far the Mennonites of northern Mexico have not been infected with the Corona virus, although there is photographic evidence that a few of their relatives from Winkler have got the bug while on the beach in Puerto Vallarta."
how Corona Virus patient shivers violently. 	"A 15-second footage of deathly coronavirus patient has gone viral. The footage is being circulated on Twitter where a woman can be seen holding the head of a patient who is hidden under a blanket.
Others wearing protective masks can be seen looking on in horror. The unseen and unknown patient can be seen shaking violently from head-to-toe.
Coronavirus can cause seizures and convulsions among some feverish sufferers.
The video emerged as it was revealed that desperate locals have been told they face a wait of up to two days to see medics in crisis-hit Wuhan. The shocking news comes as those trapped in the bug-ravaged city told of horrific doomsday-like scenes on their deserted streets.
There are now reports of desperate people going into panic mode after being told they will to have wait hours or even days to find out if they are infected.
One resident, 36-year-old Xiaoxi said she had spent the past week taking her sick husband from hospital to hospital. She just was desperate to get him tested for the virus.
She told the South China Morning Post Wuhan felt like “doomsday.”
“I don’t know if we will both live to see the new year, ” she added.
Chinese president Xi Jinping held a special government meeting to discuss the spread of virus. Corona virus has already killed 56 people and infected more than 2,000 globally."
Wuhan Corona Virus: China Runs a False Flag Operation. 	"You cannot build a hospital in six days.
You can build a morgue to conceal the problem.
My hospital spent approximately two years to build a new lobby, add a physical plant for engineering and a few campus improvement projects.
You cannot build a hospital and install all of the lines needed for your oxygen and gases, monitors, high tech equipment for ICU. This is impossible. Period.
China is building a morgue. Be carried in sick. Die behind the walls.
As a Naval officer we could put up a 500 bed tent hospital in ten days.
This was with the breakout of iso-containers with our gear for each wing of the hospital.

Life in China amid Wuhan Corona Virus.. 	"Living in China during the Wuhan Corona Virus Pandemic.
I was fresh into my internship when my eyes skimmed over some article about the Wuhan Corona virus on my phone and my first reaction was an eye-roll accompanied by a “pfft.” Given the fact I had just survived a bitchy virus of my own, I presumed I could handle whatever was next and powered off my phone. I didn’t take it seriously at all – a contrasting approach from the time of hypervigilance during the swine flu breakout when I would smother myself in hand sanitizer the moment I heard the faintest cough. I knew it was nothing but a medical fad to satisfy people’s absurd apocalyptical fantasies and wanted no part of it. After all, I never got around to watching The Walking Dead so I was nowhere near as enthusiastically freaked out about this apparently deadly virus as others.
A few days passed and I continued to walk into my internship, went into some mild coughing fits, and conversed with my colleague about her holiday plans. She mentioned she would go back to her hometown, and upon inquiring where that was, she casually answered Wuhan. “ Cool ” I shrugged before helping myself to another one of her French fries.
Yes, those were the peaceful days when there was no segregation between the Wuhanese and the rest. The days when a slight cough would not result in massive public unrest followed by an immediate evacuation of the premises. Yes, those were the days.
I was on my way home from my internship one evening when I noticed a sudden emergence of a peculiar fashion trend centered around face-wear: masks. Every where I looked, all I saw were people covered in hideous masks which made me reflexively roll my eyes twenty times. I went on to meet my flatmates for dinner, only to notice they themselves were shivering with worry, saying all sorts of things in their theatrical French accents which helped further dramatize the mood.
“ j’you j’know…. Une of our classmates left the countrY due to the err.. the virUs ” said a flatmate who’ll be referred to as Mademoiselle Rossignol. I let out a loud, inelegant laugh which attracted disgusted looks from the waiters, and then I realised I was the only one cackling like a hyena on steroids and everyone else was not amused. “ No way! ” I spat out “ Surely, that’s an overreaction! ” “ j’you… never know…. J’you know 4 pepel already dead! ” chirped Mademoiselle Rossignol in the typical French accent whereby she rose the pitch of her voice towards the end of sentence and, therefore, finished a line about death on a somewhat perky note. “ do j’you know where, err, j’we can buy ,err, masks? ” asked another Frenchie who’ll go by the name of Jean Paul. “ And, err, j’hand sanatIsers! ” added another who we’ll call Croissant.
Like an assuring godmother, I calmly told them all that we can set out to buy masks and hand sanitizers together after we finish our dinner, and that’s exactly what we went on to do with me leading the group as I wore an amused expression and tried my best not to giggle at all this ridiculousness. It wasn’t long before we arrived at the nearest health store and I gave my flatmates a smug look as if I was about to perform a cool trick of locating some masks and hand sanatisers and wanted them to applaud when I finally did it. I proceeded into the shop with a determined look and, in a true terminator style, scanned everywhere for these products, but was eventually told by the staff that they were sold out.
I paused for a while as it took some time for the words to fully sink in. Sold out?! In the two years that I have been living in China, I never heard the words “sold out” in relation to masks, let alone small bottles of hand-santisers. I felt this to be insanely bizarre but felt comfort knowing we were in the heart of Shanghai which was loaded with shops and commercial centers, so we simply dashed to another store. Also sold out. Then another. Sold out too. Another. Sold out. Every single shop we checked was out of both masks and hand santisers, and this is what launched me into a state of panic.
I paused to catch my breath and let myself drink in this situation of doom, like the realization when you took too many caffeine pills and are just waiting for yourself to explode. I saw my flatmates all had tucked their heads in the edges of their top so it could function as a mask. I noticed how the center of Shanghai was rather empty. Those that were around were all wearing masks and anxiously scuttering around. I felt my hands shake… maybe because my phone was vibrating. It was a phone call from Mommajandro. “ THIS IS INTERNATIONAL NEWS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU WEARING A MASK?! ” screamed Mommajandro the moment I answered the call. Mommajando has only one way of communicating with others and that is through shouting. “ they are all sold out… ” “ WHAT SOLD OUT. I TOLD YOU AT THE VERY BEGINNING TO GET MASKS ”. This is one of her classic moves whereby she reinvents the past to support her ‘I told you so’ narrative, when in actuality, she did no such thing. “ You said you don’t even like the idea of wearing masks in public ” “ SHUT UP ”
The phone call with Mommajandro only served to make me freak out further and I was fully preparing myself for a heart attack or an epileptic seizure. As soon as I arrived in the apartment with my flatmates, a light bulb went off in my head and I became Jesus, ordering us all a mask through a Chinese takeout app.
That was the first time when I began to grasp the severity of the situation and realized I should be more worried than I was at the time. Wuhan Corona Virus
Said to have originated in an illegal wildlife market in Wuhan, freaking out over this virus is totally the latest trend! From what I understand, if you cough and have a fever, it’s game over.
Or you may just have a common cold as the symptoms of the cold are said to be identical to those of nCOV. This is precisely why when I did a cute little sneeze in the elevator the other day, all the people inside began fidgeting and sweating nervously, desperately hoping the doors would open soon so they could escape.
The virus is spreading at an alarming rate and Wuhan is under quarantine, but as the numbers rise, so do worries. People are limiting contact with everyone and everything, abandoning pets and in some cases, children. The Current Situation
Right now, it’s as if I am trapped in a high-rise tower like Rapunzel in the modern, apocalyptic version of Disney’s Tangled. Mommajandro had taken the role of Mother Gothel as she would scream warnings through the phone every morning to ensure I do not leave the apartment. On top of that, there are the spam messages from the university which are also in-line with Mommjandro’s thoughts. I only occasionally leave the apartment to take my food delivery and even then my fashion-freedom is restricted, thanks to the importance placed on protective clothing over style.
This virus has and continues to ruin everything.
Let’s start with the fact that I live at the heart of Shanghai – only 10 minutes walk from the bund, and a few minutes from the iconic East Nanjing Road which is equivalent to Times Square in New York — and yet, I can’t enjoy any of it because of this killjoy virus.
This level of quarantine wasn’t something that happened overnight where I woke up and just decided it would be fun to trap myself, but it was rather a smooth transition. After our discovery of the mask shortage, I was still chill about going out to eat and meeting friends but I soon realised others didn’t share my way of thinking. The usually bustling downtown area of the city suddenly went full-on silent with only a few people walking by. Even the street vendors who would usually yell at the top of their lungs whenever anyone would pass by, had surprisingly sealed their mouth shut.
I would send pictures of dishes at restaurants to friends who, rather than replying with a supportive “Looks yummy!”, would question my sanity that I was still out during this time and tell me to go home or to the nearest mental institution. The subways were quiet with only a few people there, mostly staff workers and old people who clearly did not fear death. There was a time when an unmasked guy approached me and began speaking, resulting in me panicking and running away, only to look back and notice the guy was chasing after me.
There was a time when I was strolling around with music in my ear phones, looking for a restaurant, and then a song came on with lyrics as follows: I am walking in the wrong lane to a place unknown My head is filled with you, I am in my comfort zone But when I ring your bell, I see you’ve left me alone. Where are you? I am wondering what to do? I am missing you, try to call your phone but you left me in the cold. THE STREETS ARE LONELY!! ! THE DARKNESS CLOSING IN ON ME. I AM JUST CIRCLING AROUND…. AROUND AND AROUND…. The timing of the song couldn’t be more befitting to the situation at the time because it turns out that while I was looking for a restaurant to eat, I was actually circling around and around the same area. I freaked out, removed my earphones and sought refuge in the nearest restaurant.
Then the death tolls continued to rise.
More messages came in.
And phone calls.
And rumours.
All of these little things added up and skyrocketed my blood pressure, leading me to eventually make the final decision of putting myself under quarantine. Others’ take on the Situation
This pandemic has incited varying responses from different types of people, ranging from not leaving the room to leaving the entire country.
Let’s start with Renée. If you read the previous blog-post regarding my travels with Renée, you would know she is someone deeply cherished by Jesus due to her unbelievable level of luck that she attributes to her belief in Jesus Christ. And so do I. This leads me to think that while everyone is counting on their own government to make a move, this woman probably has divine protection and Jesus has most likely already granted her full immunity from the virus. Despite this, she has taken strictest of measures in the student dormitory in Suzhou, isolating herself from the student group , rejecting invitations to any parties. I know better than to ignore any advice she has to offer so the moment she told me to get some vodka as a rumoured preventative measure against the virus, I put all my suspicions aside and simply ordered a bottle. May Jesus extend his protection to me too.
Other students in my university are leaving the country or have already left and delayed their return to China.
My flatmate, Mademoiselle Rossignol, decided to follow the footsteps of her classmate and also get out of the country. She has already booked a flight to sweep her away to France. Despite this, she didn’t want to leave without a final party, holding it in our flat inviting some heavy coughers for a fun night! They probably had the common cold (or so we hope.)
Others are also not letting the virus ruin their fun, holding house parties but with some conditions attached. Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati
But while most people are taking preventative measures, there is one particular student in our programme who simply refuses to give a fuck, and has taken advantage of the situation to visit all the scenic spots which would usually be crowded if not for the virus. Introducing Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati.
As a Chernobyl survivor, Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati has seen it all and remains unfettered, doing all sorts of things during a time when a quarantine is recommended.
But oh no. Not for Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati who wants to climb mountains, visit gardens, hop on public buses all the whilst recommending everyone else to stay inside as part of her plan to enjoy everything to herself. Well played, Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati.
Pets and Corona Virus
A friend by the name of Rosalina invited me over to the apartment she was at because she was looking after a dog for a couple who escaped the country under the pretext of a “holiday”. I didn’t need any convincing because the moment I heard the three-lettered word ‘dog’, was the moment I dashed to the subway ready to make my way over. I have quite a history with these furry fluff balls and my story would put whatever cheesy dog movie to shame anytime, anyday. I am just saying Marley & Me would’ve been a bigger, wider hit rather than the snoozefest it is if I had been the scriptwriter. I am a hard core dog lover and not in a wanting-to-eat kind of way so, naturally, Rosalina’s offer to come by her place and meet the dog was met with a resounding “Yes”, on the basis I wanted to see the dog more than her.
We’ll call the dog Rosalina was looking after the typical generic Fluffy . I naturally couldn’t keep my hands off Fluffy and kept drunkenly petting it throughout the night. In some situations my touches became borderline homicidal, and the only reason I didn’t end up killing it was due to how weak I was, but God knows if I “lifted” and “benched”, I would’ve accidentally squeezed the life out of the little thing. Yes, I had oceans of love to offer Fluffy, but sadly, such love was short-lived.
The morning after, Rosalina and I went through the usual virus-proofing routine as we strapped on masks before taking beloved Fluffy out for a not-so-relaxing walk. Fluffy seemed like a very responsible dog as he would pee and poo everywhere but then go on to lick the city clean, as if it was his way of apologizing for defecating in some scenic spots earlier. But that was the problem with Fluffy. It was blissfully oblivious to the pandemic, unaware that it was no longer safe to lick everywhere in this virus infested city. Every time he would decide to sweep up some germs with his tongue, I would freeze in fear with eyes bulging out in disbelief. Not only that but this dog had a crazy bladder as he would pee every five seconds, making me think whether this was symptomatic of the corona virus in dogs.
When we arrived home, the dog ran up to the sofa and rolled all over it as if it was marking it with it’s scent, leading me to deem the sofa unsafe for human usage before I told Rosalina I could not stay and left immediately.
Yeah, yeah. So much for being a “hardcore dog lover” but this story still beats Marley & Me. I was later assured that dogs and cats cannot get this Corona virus but I ain’t risking it.
I am sorry, Fluffy. ❤️
Fluffy isn’t alone to being subjected to such cruel behaviour of abandonment (Yes, admittingly by myself). The word is that many disloyal owners are throwing out their pets as they are afraid of catching the corona virus from them, and this has resulted in an uptick in woofs and meows you would hear outside.
Recently, me and my flatmates heard a series of meows outside our own flat. Panic ensued when I opened the door and there was cat in the corridor – it somehow made it to the 21 st floor because my flatmates reported seeing it on the ground floor not so long ago. I immediately took action and used an umbrella to poke it into the elevator and sent it back down, much to its dismay.
Later, however, when I went outside to take my delivered food, the same cat was there and clung on to me with its potentially infected paws. In a necessary act of animal cruelty, I gently kicked it away but then when it came running back and touched my fucking feet, I was enraged and considered the idea of dropping it off a balcony to end its misery. Yes, the current panicky atmosphere in combination with my lack of respect for cats really led to some terribly dark thoughts. Luckily, I never acted upon that particular idea because an unsuspecting woman came by soon after and the cat, in a desperate attempt to be adopted, went into an elevator with her. Yes, this does seem like a beginning of a horror movie, doesn’t it? Poor woman.
At the place of my internship, we also have a cat who is a mega-diva. There was a time when we wanted to take advantage of his cuteness and use him in a greeting card, but he just would not cooperate and threw tantrums left, right, and center before heading into his own automated smart-home. I do hope he stays safe and is not abandoned by our company because my god, that cat is not made for street life. The future ahead – or the lack of.
Are you scared? I am. But not of death – I have reached a point in my life where I welcome death with open arms. But I am scared of dying in a Chinese hospital where there is a huge language barrier, and loved ones not being able to visit for a final goodbye. Death is nothing to worry about. It’s the moments before.
But if you gotta go, you gotta go."
KBRA Releases Research – Coronavirus (COVID-19). 	"Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) releases research on the potential ramifications of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on aircraft values and lease rates. KBRA believes that aircraft values and lease rate declines will be contingent on two factors, namely, the speed of economic recovery and the path that surviving airlines take in deciding the composition of their fleets post-coronavirus.
Roughly half of the total global passenger fleet was parked as a result of severe travel restrictions. Further, we expect that many aircraft may be removed from service through early retirement and/or be returned to lessors at lease end, in anticipation of significant passenger traffic reduction. Aircraft lessors will be tested as more aircraft would need to be remarketed as a result of lease expiry and airline bankruptcies, resulting in more downward pressure on lease rates.
As the coronavirus’ impact continues the shape of economic recovery is becoming increasing more difficult to predict, but KBRA believes the younger, fuel-efficient aircraft are best positioned to be key for airlines and lessors post-pandemic."
The Corona Virus and why I am a “Nationalist.”. 	"It is not politically correct to be a ‘nationalist’ these days, but that’s largely because of the self-serving myths that globalists like to engage in and a general lack of historical knowledge and rational thinking. The word ‘nationalist’ brings to mind the Nazis, where we are regularly reminded that they were “National Socialists”, emphasizing the first word in the phrase, but never the second. Like I said, self-serving myths.
However, while the word ‘socialist’ hasn’t changed all that much since the 1930’s, the word ‘nationalist’ has. In other words, its a logical fallacy called ‘equivocation,’ where the same word has two different meanings. Globalists (and the MSM, the general public, liberal progressives, etc) invoke the old meaning to criticize adherents of the new meaning.
There was indeed something nasty about the “old” nationalists, but people don’t really like to acknowledge what it is. Was much of it ‘racist’? Yes, of course. But it was ‘racist’ for a reason: they believed that SCIENCE had shown, in light of Darwinism, that the races were definitely different, and indeed some races were superior to others. And yet, it is still not fair to equate the “old” nationalism with racism, as, in point of fact, racism was infused into anti -nationalist, communist, and even progressive views, as well . Yet, people recoil in horror at the word ‘nationalist’ but carry on their merry way when they hear the word ‘progressive.’
The reason why people don’t like to admit the historical reality of the pervasiveness (beyond, except, when ascribed to ‘nationalists’) of ‘scientific racism’ is because they still like to claim the mantle of SCIENCE, which at present still accepts Darwinism as true and valid. They want their Darwinism without the part where they behave as if it is actually true, which is pretty much all that separates them from the progressives of the 1920’s to 1930’s, where they were courageous enough to behave as though Darwinism was true.
I have a whole page on my eugenics website dedicated to progressives complaining that people would not submit to SCIENCE and instead resort to sentimentality.
The short story here on how Darwinism became attached to these ‘political’ aspects is that the prevailing notion of the time that a ‘nation’ was basically a repository for a particular subset of the human species, and that such subsets could themselves be seen as operating on Darwinian principles. Eg, the ‘social organism.’ Thus, there was ‘survival of the fittest’ not just between rival, individual organisms, but also between populations. We still have the concept today, actually. It is called “intraspecific competition.” (And thus, why it is the case that so long as Darwinism is believed to be true, there will be people who believe it ought to be extended to ‘race’, etc).
Germany believed it was the fittest and that it had the evolutionary right and obligation, as a people, to devour those who were not as fit–and this would be good for the entire human race. This explains that little known fact that before the Nazis began wide scale extermination of the Jews, they first launched the T4 project, in which hundreds of thousands of GERMAN citizens who were disabled, mentally ill, etc, were exterminated. Such people dragged down the ‘social organism’ (eg, “useless eaters”) and stood in the way of a ‘fit’“body.” This was laid out in Binding and Hoche’s “ Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life ” which was published years before the Nazi party even existed. The ‘nation’ was in essence an ‘organism’ subject to Darwinian principles.
Germany was country to have a large concentration of people who believed such things. Turkey (when killing the Armenians) had a similar conception, as did Japan (the Rape of Nanking, killing of prisoners, etc). WW1 was, as you can imagine, a humiliation for Germany and Turkey, who believed they were biologically superior. Likewise Japan after WW2. But there were people who had this notion diffused throughout the world, including the United States: This is not theory, but fact, and displays its force as fact, whatever theories may be thrown across its track.Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice . Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life ,
Woodrow Wilson. American president.
Yipes!
It will be hard to find many more ‘internationalist’ than Wilson without going full Bolshevik. So, like I said, this ‘nasty’ business is not at all uniquely identifiable with early 20th century ‘nationalism.’
So, look. Even if it logically follows from Darwinism that nations should be seen as “living organisms” that must “obey the laws of life”, there are very few people who believe that, today. And certainly not most ‘nationalists.’
AND CERTAINLY NOT ME. (I, for one, think Darwinism is excrement.)
I lead with this, because the Globalists like to think that it is thanks to them and their institutions that the world has enjoyed relative peace after WW2. Ah, no.
First of all, this Darwinian-infused notion of ‘nationalism’ that existed prior to WW2 disappeared for the same reason that eugenics itself fell by the wayside. Eugenicists were humiliated by the outcome of WW2, shocked that their ideas could lead to such horrors. They repackaged and pursued their views via ‘ crypto-eugenics ‘ afterwards. But there was not much room for a ‘social body’ explanation anymore, as the countries which postured as Supremely Superior biologically speaking were destroyed… by American mutts.
The Globalists like to invoke international organizations, especially the UN, but they are reluctant to mention NATO in the same analysis. NATO is an international organization, but it is an organization centered on exerting MILITARY POWER. And within NATO, the number one puncher is, hands down, without a doubt, the United States of America. To cut to the chase, the relative peace the world has enjoyed has been thanks to the USA and its doctrine of being ready to fight–and win–a global war fought on two fronts.
Without the US, most of the world would be speaking German, Japanese, and/or Russian right now. That’s a fact.
Globalists want to trumpet the success of their institutions while ignoring the protective shield that the United States has provided for them over the decades. They are like the secretary who works in the office of a NFL football team that wins the Super Bowl. Sure, the secretary gets the ring, just like the players, and indeed, the secretary has contributed to the overall success of the team, but no one would fail to understand that the ones who chiefly provided the victory were the ones on the field, slamming away at another team for four quarters.
In the same way, the UN has perhaps done some occasional good, but whatever good they accomplished they accomplished because the US (primarily) was standing behind them with a billy club.
But I would dispute even the idea that we can even say there has been ‘relative peace’ after WW2. There hasn’t been another World War but that does not seem like the only criterion that should be on the table. Let’s be real: since WW2, hundreds of million were killed in various communist countries, there were civil wars, there were genocides in Rwanda (also infused with Darwinism) and Cambodia, etc., etc. Relative peace? I think not.
Events like Rwanda lay bare the failure of globalism… the eventual salvation of whatever Tutsis that were left was thanks to other , armed Tutsis, that came over the border. Maybe Kuwait can thank the international community for rescuing it from Saddam, but the Kurds, who were immediately abandoned after Kuwait was liberated might have another view. (Inexplicably, the globalists thought leaving Saddam alive and in power was a good idea, and Saddam used the opportunity to secure his position, by killing loads of Kurds.)
Relative peace in the United States and the West, perhaps, but that’s as far as it goes.
Having a realistic true history of the 20th century is critical, I think, because there is very little in it to support the notion that any of us can trust our safety and security to bureaucrats who reside thousands of miles away, unless, perhaps, they are bureaucrats working in the Pentagon.
So, in my conception of ‘nationalism’, I am going back to something which pre-dates even Darwinism. When the United States was founded, the individual states were essentially and effectively viewed as sovereign nations in their own right. On this republican (small ‘r’) view, the powers of the federation were narrowly construed, and the nations–that is, American states–served as an important check and balance on tyranny at the federation level.
I am a ‘nationalist,’ in this sense, because I believe that in light of the realities of human history, extremely robust checks and balances are needed in every place where power is centered. Ultimately, the citizens of the many nations should be construed as the final check and balance, and should be armed in such a way that the tyrants really are afraid to over-reach. But what to do when other nations over-step and over-reach right into your own nation?
Well, in the past, one generally assumed that the people leading your own nation would put their foot down and attempt to protect the interests of the people who elected those leaders. But this is not the case when globalists run the show, especially when they are the ones at the steering wheel. Many examples could be given, but for the purpose of this post, I’m going to use the corona virus to explain, with some reference to the ebola outreak about six years ago.
The reaction to the corona virus has, in my mind, generally shown the powerful way that nations can be a check and balance against other nations. It did not take very long for individual countries to start locking down their borders, quarantining people coming from suspected regions in China, etc., etc. Excellent. As it should be.
Given such events, we do begin to see some of the narrow instances where are our international organizations have value. These epidemics have an international component almost by definition. But it is one thing to let these people do their work and it is quite another to give them governance .
Why? Because they don’t care about you , that’s why. Well, not exclusively, anyway. To the globalist, your interests needs to be weighed against the interests of other people’s interests, and, naturally, they are in their mind perfectly suited to be the arbiter in such things.
Thus, for example, let’s pretend that it was determined that it appeared there was going to be an outbreak leading to thousands of deaths in either region X or region Y. It could not be stopped. It was going to happen in one of these places. The only question was whether or not we could direct it to a particular region, and then actually do it. The globalist feels perfectly comfortable weighing the relative merits of each option. Perhaps they will not be quite happy that people in region X will suffer if region Y is spared, but again, on their view, it falls to them to be concerned about the people in both regions.
Now, if you happen to live in region X, you might feel altogether differently about it. It is your kids, your wife or husband, your livelihood, perhaps even your life on the line. It is you being asked to ‘take the hit.’ And the globalist? Well, he doesn’t answer to you, does he? You have no way to hold him accountable. You didn’t elect him. You will probably never learn his name. What if the entire premise is wrong–that is to say, perhaps in point of fact, there is no reason to believe that it WAS going to happen in one of those two places in the first place. That is, the globalist was wrong .
Can you imagine that? A globalist being wrong? (The globalist can’t believe it.) And to whom or to what can you appeal in that case?
If, in fact, there are significant checks and balances on the globalist and/or his institutions, the globalist can end up doing a lot of damage. The nationalist certainly can do a lot of damage, too. What is the only way to check either? Other nations.
In the Ebola incident, more than 11,000 people died . This is more than a third of all those believed to have been impacted. At present, almost the same number of people believed to have been infected (officially) is the same as in the Ebola incident (around 28,000) but there have only been a little over 500 deaths. [ This seems reliable enough .] It strikes me as strange that in the Ebola outbreak, amid calls to shut down travel from that region, etc, there were globalists who decried such measures as ‘mean’, despite the disease killing 1 out of every 3 individuals, whereas with the Corona Virus, no one really had to issue any calls to take action because everyone–nations, international organizations, etc,–took appropriate action immediately… including shutting down travel from out of that region! This, when the Corona Virus, by comparison, is only killing (so far) 1 out of every 50 individuals. And no one accusing anyone for being mean!
Is it because the Chinese are not as lovable in the globalists’ eyes as the West Africans? I really don’t know the answer, but it does strike me as odd.
The thing that really bothered me during the Ebola incident was the clear fact that the Globalist-in-Chief, Obama, seemed perfectly prepared to subsume the interests and welfare of the United States. The US was basically the ‘region X’ from the scenario above. The nightmare was that the one actually elected to represent us didn’t seemed to care all that much about us. And hence, a lesson about electing globalists to represent you.
There are many examples that I could give to expound on this, but the corona virus thing seems to illustrate one of the benefits of having nations led by people concerned for the people who have placed them into power. There is no hint that this time around there are going to be calls for a global kumbaya because individual countries are proactively defending their own citizens.
Might this mean that somewhere down the line we may have to ‘rescue’ China? Perhaps. I’m sure many a ‘nationalist’ like myself will be happy to consider the prospects and act if necessary. What we don’t like is being called upon to sacrifice our own lives, the lives of our loved ones, or our general welfare, by the very people who were supposed to represent us.
Indeed, in a case like this, it seems the oxygen mask analogy would be appropriate. When you are on an airplane, they counsel you to put the oxygen mask on yourself, first, before tending to those less able to fend for themselves. The reason for this is very simple: if they are less able to fend for themselves, they are less able to help YOU, if you falter. Thus, helping yourself first isn’t merely being ‘selfish’ of ‘uncompassionate.’ By saving one (yourself), you increase the odds of saving both.
If healthier nations are asked to accept risks in order to dilute the risks to the other, less healthy nation, this could jeopardize our ability to help both.
Other examples abound, as I said. I am using the corona virus to illustrate.
But an aside before I move on.
I recently had a face to face conversation with a politician and the topic was oriented towards protecting the interests of my family. This politician, very earnest and genuine, hastened to remind me that he had to look after the interests of all the families in the area. This is the globalist spirit, writ smaller. You see, there are two ways of approaching such issues. In one approach, you recognize that you can’t be everyone’s daddy, even if you wanted to, and so, being concerned (genuinely) for all the families in the area, you strive to equip ALL the parents so that they can do what they are best situated to do–tend to their own families. In the other approach, you say, “Well, there are families that will not have parents who can do their job, so, hell, I guess I’ll just be everyone’s parent.”
There is no argument with the former viewpoint. It is the second viewpoint where problems emerge. Practically speaking, nobody can be everyone’s daddy. The globalist pretends that he is intellectually, spiritually, and morally capable of balancing the unique needs and interests of every single person on the globe, and from his Godlike perch, able also to act appropriately. But, although he may not ever see the damage he does (he probably won’t bother to look to see if he hurt someone along the way; for the globalist, only his good intentions matter, not the actual outcomes), there will be thousands of unanticipated consequences because, well, in point of fact, the globalist is NOT God.
One of the unanticipated (to them) consequences is that by acting to be everyone’s daddy, they necessarily enact and pursue policies which make it harder for actual fathers to appropriately protect their own family.
Consider a hypothetical to illustrate. Let’s say that I lived in a flood zone. Being the proactive father that I am, let’s say that I acquire a boat in order to get my family out of the area if it came to it. But my local globalist thinks its unfair that some people don’t have boats in case of flooding. To solve the problem, he outlaws private ownership of boats, and creates an agency which is in charge of all the boats, which they will then dispatch as necessary. On paper, perhaps, this will help the overall community in case of a flood, but it has come at the expense of taking my boat. Now I don’t have a boat if there is a flood. I cannot get them away and return in my boat to help others, because I have no boat.
And if my family drowns because the new agency fouled up in their response–or even if they acted effectively, but were constrained by circumstances–should I be happy that I was asked to sacrifice my family so that other people, who had perfectly good opportunities to be proactive themselves, but didn’t, could, theoretically, live?
Your globalists thinks you should be very happy. And why not? It isn’t his family.
Many, many, many, many policies and viewpoints are advanced exactly along those lines. In the name of the community, they deprive, disarm, defund, etc, individuals. At least as long as there are such things as ‘nations’/’states’, counties, municipalities, and townships, etc, where there is a halfway decent chance of reflecting the actual interests of the actual people who elect them, there is a good chance that some seriously bad (totalitarian level) things never take place.
Thus, I am a ‘nationalist,’ in just the same sense that I consider my home state to be a nation. Or, at least it used to be. With the steady encroachment of wanna-be-daddies over the last hundred years, even what we have is at risk. Someday, the globalists will foul it up so much that even they can’t deny what happened. (Remember, as a general rule, they rarely investigate the outcomes of their policies). Can you imagine how many people will have suffered and died in order to catch their attention at last?
It makes me shudder to think of it. Anthony"

What does it mean now that 2 cats tested positive for COVID-19?. 	"Two pet cats in New York state tested positive for the new coronavirus this week, marking the first time a pet in the United States has tested positive for COVID-19.
Following the news, many viewers reached out to VERIFY with their questions. So we tackled some of your most common questions about your furry family members and coronavirus.
THE QUESTIONS Is it possible my pets could further spread the disease? Are my pets in danger? Is testing pets using possible tests for people?
THE ANSWER The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently advises that there is no evidence that pets play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus. Still, they urge you to exercise caution when taking care of your pet amidst this pandemic.
Both of the cats in question had mild cases and are recovering, according to officials. There are currently no cases of an animal having severe COVID-19 symptoms.
The USDA said COVID-19 testing for pets does not hinder testing for humans in any way.
WHAT WE FOUND So first, let’s go over exactly what happened to these cats.
The USDA says both cats were from New York state, although they were from different parts of the state and their illnesses were unrelated. Both of them have mild respiratory symptoms but both are expected to make a full recovery.
The owner of one cat had COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs of illness while no one in the other cat’s household has had the illness yet. The USDA said it’s possible the cat got the illness from an asymptomatic carrier in the house or contact with an infected person outside the home.
These are the first confirmed instances in the U.S. of pets contracting COVID-19. In response, CDC updated their guidance involving animals and coronavirus.
RELATED: Two pet cats in New York state test positive for coronavirus
RELATED: Tiger at New York City's Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus
Originally, the CDC stated that pets were unlikely to be at risk of getting COVID-19 because they had no evidence of pets getting the disease. The CDC now advises that you treat pets like you would humans in your household -- don’t let them come in close contact with strangers and keep people diagnosed with COVID-19 away from pets.
The CDC also added that the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to humans is low “based on the limited information available to date.” They say there is no evidence pets play a significant role in spreading the virus.
So far, four animals in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the USDA’s list . All four have been felines in the state of New York. The first confirmed case involved a tiger in a New York zoo and the second was a lion also in a New York zoo.
The USDA does not currently recommend routine animal testing for COVID-19. Still, they maintain it does not impair human testing at all.
In the agency's animal testing FAQ , the USDA explained tests for animals use reagents not required for human COVID-19 tests and thus should not reduce the availability of tests for people. The tests are performed by veterinarians instead of doctors.
So, what are some big takeaways from all of this? Yes, your pet can get COVID-19 so you should avoid cuddling it if you’re sick and you shouldn’t let strangers pet it for the time being. So far, all pets with coronavirus have had mild symptoms and testing these animals has not impacted human testing at all.

Hamilton bar offering patrons cheap Corona beers 'while pandemic lasts' asked by Lion to stop. 	"A Hamilton bar offering Corona deals ""while pandemic lasts"" has pulled an ad labelled 'deplorable' by the Race Relations Commissioner.
The House on Hood Facebook page put up a post on Wednesday to promote a $6.50 Corona deal and said ""mention your Corona loving mates to let them know about this great deal and you could be sharing a free one metre pizza"".
The Corona virus , which originated in Wuhan, China, has so far killed 132 people globally and left more than 4500 sick.
The post has a picture of two men in boiler suits wearing masks and gloves holding the beer. ""Virus or no virus, we still think Coronas are pretty great, so while the pandemic lasts, we're selling Coronas for just $6.50,"" it says.

​ * We're much more vulnerable to the spread of viruses than we once were
Supplied A post promoting $6.50 Corona's ""while the pandemic lasts"" is attracting mixed responses on Facebook. Human Rights Commission Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon slammed the ad as ""absolutely bad taste"".
""It's deplorable that this business is capitalising on people dying.""
When he saw the picture Foon said he felt ""sick to the core"".
Using this situation to gain financial gain was just not on, he said.
When the Whakaari/White Island eruption, and the Christchurch terror attack, happened there were no such promotions, he said.
""People are sick in the mind.""
Lawrenson Group chief executive officer John Lawrenson, who owns House on Hood, told Stuff he thought the original ad was fine and had expected this kind of reaction.
""About 90 per cent of people react with a like or a laugh and about 10 per cent with an angry or sad face.
""However, the 10 per cent are very vocal and share and comment to express their displeasure and that seems to drastically increase the reach of the ad for us.""
However, hours later the ad was taken down, and replaced with a toned down version, after Lion said said they did not condone it.
""We have been in touch with the venue and asked that it be discontinued,"" a spokesperson said.
Lawrenson said Lion had no clout to stop him doing the post, as he did not actually buy his Corona from them. But someone had called him and asked him nicely for a favour, so he said yes.
He had reworked the post and uploaded a picture of a Corona bottle wearing a protective mask. ""Let's be honest, there are worse things you can catch in Hamilton. Coronas still $6.50 all summer long"", it says.
King St advertising chief executive officer Chris Williams said he had been waiting for someone to do something like this.
While he said shock advertising could do well in the short-term, he didn't think it was right to cash in on this situation.
""It's in bad taste and just not right. People are dying.""
Williams said he didn't think the term ""any publicity was good publicity"" applied anymore and said this ad was no different to Otago cartoonist Garrick Tremain's cartoon mocking the deadly Samoan measles epidemic .
""That was terrible as well. This is no different in many ways.""
Hamilton Mayor Paula Southgate also thought the ad was really insensitive.
""People have lost their lives and people are fearful of it,"" she said.
""I'm not a fan of what I would describe as poor taste.""
The original post received mixed responses on Facebook, with some people calling it ""shameful"" and other ""brilliant"".
CHRIS SKELTON/STUFF Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon felt ""sick to the core"" when he saw the ad.
This isn't the first time House on Hood has used current affairs as an advertising opportunity.
They played on a crude joke Hamilton City Councillor Mark Bunting sent to freelance journalist Angela Cuming in 2017, but later deleted the post at the request of council.
When Metiria Turei was in trouble with Winz they posted a meme as well as when Bill English lost the Eminem case for copyright and NZ First and Labour formed a coalition.
Lawrenson said they had covered a range of topical personalities in the past, from Bill English, Simon Bridges and Israel Folau to Brian Tamaki, Greta Thunberg and Metiria Turei.
""It's unavoidable that some will disagree with the approach, but many others love it, and it has certainly been successful.""
Lawrenson said the success of these ads was based on the fact in society there was a small per cent of the population that took it upon themselves to be outraged on behalf of everyone else.
""I guess I would say to them that just because they are offended, it doesn't mean that everyone else is. There are probably far more impactful things they could be doing with their time than frantically typing on their keyboards."""
Homeopathy Treatment of Corona Virus. 	"Homeopathy Treatment of Corona Virus Last Updated On: February 3, 2020
With the advent of the third case of coronavirus reported in India, its a cause of grave concern for us and hence today we are going to shed further light on to how to combat this outbreak.
All the cases were reported in Kerala itself, where the first patient was a former student from Wuhan University in China ( the city where the virus originated).
Followed this, Indian Government is preparing to evacuate its citizens from China’s Wuhan city via airlift. The USA has also given protocol to its citizens not to travel to China, till further notice. Similarly Indian citizens are also urged to refrain from travelling there.
The Ministry of AYUSH on Wednesday issued an advisory for the “prevention” of infection from this novel strain of coronavirus using homoeopathy. The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy(CCRH), in the 64th meeting of its Scientific advisory board on 28thJanuary,2020, discussed the ways and means of prevention of Coronavirus infection through Homoeopathy. It also gives some dietary recommendations of easily digestible, light and soft diets, apart from personal hygiene tips to prevent this air-borne infection.
Before this new strain came into being, there were six other coronavirus strains — including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This newly discovered strain is designated as 2019-nCoV and commonly called the ‘novel strain’. Among humans, three other strains of coronavirus continuously circulate and cause pneumonia, bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, and even the common cold.
It is believed to have originated last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife meat. Health experts suspect it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species. Coronaviruses thrive more in the winter and are airborne. The typical incubation period for a cold-causing coronavirus strain is three days, however, for the novel strain, this period is anywhere between two to 10 days.
Till now it has killed 362 people and infected more than 17000. Fewer than 100 cases have been recorded outside China by spreading to 23 other countries, including India’s neighbours Nepal and Sri Lanka, and Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and US etc. The first death outside of Chinawas recorded in Philippines today. The Cabinet Secretary of GOI has reviewed the preventive measures on the coronavirus outbreak with secretaries in the ministries of health, external affairs, civil aviation etc. Approximately 35,000 people have undergone thermal screening in the country and a list has been served to the health ministries of various states of the people who recently travelled to China.
According to the AYUSH ministry advisory, following are some tips for prevention: Maintain personal hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid spitting in public. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your face during cough or sneeze and wash your hands after coughing or sneezing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Preferably, use an N95 mask while travelling or working in public places to avoid droplet transmission If you suspect Corona Viral infection, wear a mask and contact your nearest hospital immediately.
Alarming signs of infection include fever, generalised weakness ( fatigue), cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.In more severe cases, it can lead to leukopenia, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Homeopathic medicine can serve beautifully as preventive medicine against the infection.
It should also be taken into account that homoeopathy works based on the symptoms present in patients. Also according to the geographical conditions and climate the symptoms of a coronavirus patient may slightly differ in India compared to that of China.
Homeopathic therapeutics are based on symptom similarity and so there are over 100plus medicines that , if selected carefully , have the capability to treat viral diseases. Some homeopathic remedies have the ability to prevent viruses from attacking.
Since virus attacks on our immune system making it weaker day by day, homoeopathy works to improve it along with acting as a preventive to control and stop the spread of the Epidemic. Prescriptions in such cases can be chosen by your physician either as a constitutional prescription or in the form of a similar nosode, further profiling the concept of Genus epidemicus ( a specific remedy chosen for an epidemic on a common symptom picture).

Epidemic corona: Detects where people are immune to corona virus. 	"The local people living near a mysterious cave in Yunnan, China was discovered to be immune to the coronavirus lethal despite them living next to thousands of bats carrying many dangerous pathogens . Researchers at the bat cave
According to the Daily Star, a secret cave filled with wild bats can hold the key to quenching the new strain of corona strain that is raging in China.
People living near the mysterious cave in Yunnan, China, have been found immune to deadly corona virus despite being living alongside thousands of bats carrying dangerous pathogens.
The exact location of the bat cave is unknown - where people living nearby carry antibodies against the corona virus
The discovery began in 2004 by SARS scientists who killed 774 people.
Experts returned to the cave in 2017 to collect bat samples - and discovered they were infected with a virus that resembles 96% of the new corona virus that causes acute pneumonia in Wuhan.
Bats are thought to be a source of corona virus infection to humans because they are widely sold in markets in China.
Bats are animals that carry a lot of dangerous pathogens
The researchers also said. 3% of people living near bats carry antibodies that protect them against corona virus family.
Although the coronary pneumonia outbreak has spread to many countries around the world and infected more than 45,000 people, more than 1,100 people have died, in many places bats are still sold as a specialty.
Salesmen in Indonesia said their bat and curry sales were stable. Mr. Stenly Timbuleng from Tomohon, Indonesia, said he still sells up to 60 bats a day. However, during the festive season, he claimed he could sell up to 600 birds a day."
Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected Patients. 	"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (“S-Trimer”) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag © technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.
“I am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses”.
“We are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.”

Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.
About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
The new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus."
Proof - Corona virus is a Bioweapon. 	"I'm a commander who currently has access to the Bio-weapon Defence department of the Romanian Ministry of Defence. Pic proof with date stamp attached linked. We started to work on the Coronavirus a while ago, and their results strongly correlate with the outbreak in china.
Here's some basic info you should know:
>Actual mortality rate is around 12%
>Several more will survive with permanent disabilities
>Even if you're ""cured"", the virus remains in your semen for another few months
>It's extremely infectious. more infectious than the common cold
>It will eventually reach Europe if it hasn't already. I heard that a few higher-ups demanded a total cessation of china-EU air travel, but a bunch of countries (esp. the five eye nations) refused that due to the diplomatic crisis it would take.
My best advice is to stay indoors(home), avoiding all public areas whenever possible.
That's all.Good luck on survival if you get infected guys.

Op-Ed: I'm an immigrant doctor treating COVID-19 patients. Death isn't my only fear right now. 	"I'm an immigrant doctor treating COVID-19 patients. Death isn\'t my only fear right now I am a kidney doctor in rural Pennsylvania, caring for COVID-19 patients and trying my best to survive despite limited supplies of personal protective equipment.
I am also one of some 300,000 Indians in the United States on a H-1B work visa, waiting in line for a green card that would give me legal permanent residency.
My greatest fear is that if I contract and die from COVID-19, my wife, who is on a dependent visa, will be asked to go back to India. My 1-year-old daughter, an American citizen by birth, cannot travel with her as the Indian government has a travel embargo on all foreign citizens to limit entry of COVID-19 patients.
Every year, the United States issues 140,000 green cards based on employment. A maximum of 7% can go to any single country (usually, only 3,000). This system has resulted in a backlog of several hundred thousand immigrants from India waiting for permanent residency status. Their immigration petitions have been approved, but there are no green cards available. The Cato Institute and other agencies estimate the wait time for Indian immigrants approved today to be up to 150 years .
The never-ending wait is sheer torture. After paying taxes for decades, I would not be eligible for Social Security in retirement. Getting a driver's license requires multiple trips to the DMV, waiting for immigration verification. There is a court battle going on over whether my wife and immigrants like her can work during their decades in limbo. Many employers are unwilling to deal with hiring people on a work visa, like me. Most credit unions will not make me a member and lenders will not consider me for a mortgage.
Most of my friends and patients are happily oblivious of this situation. A lot of people seem to think that I can just walk to an immigration office, fill out some applications and get citizenship. They don't realize that there is no viable path for immigrants like me. Politicians claim to be ""for"" legal immigration and ""against"" illegal immigration all the time. Yet, initiatives to help highly skilled immigrants have gotten nowhere.
One proposal, the federal Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act , was approved in the House but has been stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this pandemic, it would make good sense to eliminate country caps by declaring a onetime, emergency increase in the number of green cards issued to immigrants with critically required skills.
Doctors from India like me make up around 5.1% of the total physician workforce in the United States. With the never-ending wait, many of them are abandoning their American dream and taking their skills elsewhere. Their absence will be felt even more in public health crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak. I hope and pray that this situation gets resolved before I am forced to join this exodus.
In the meantime, I will keep on being extra diligent with my reused personal protective equipment. I cannot afford to die while waiting for a green card.

How do you know that you are infected with Corona virus?. 	 Arabic.net Just “sneeze” or mention the word Corona is enough to panic and terrify The deadly virus It’s spreading lives in China and other countries, but how do you know that you have this virus and not the common flu? There are facts about the virus, according to the World Health Organization, as the virus is able to maintain its life and spread for up to 6 days. It is also easy to pass the virus on to others, just by breathing, using patient’s tools, or touching contaminated surfaces. 12 days incubation Front-line doctors at the epidemic from Jinentan Hospital in Wuhan said that the incubation period of the Corona Virus is 12 days, which means that the virus will pass from the infected person to others without the patient’s knowledge. According to BBC. The initial symptoms are similar to the common flu, such as sneezing, coughing, sinus obstruction, and high fever. However, it is not possible for the patient to distinguish between corona and regular influenza, through the apparent symptoms only, but it requires microscopic blood tests and serological tests. The first victim According to the doctors at the Jintin Hospital in Wuhan, the first patients dying of the disease appeared to be in good health. But the two have been smokers for many years, which may mean that the lungs of both of them were really tired. The first casualty was a 61-year-old man, who was suffering from severe pneumonia upon arrival at the hospital. The man was suffering from severe shortness of breath, which means that his lungs were unable to deliver enough oxygen to his body to survive. Despite being placed on a ventilator, his lungs and heart stopped working. The man or the woman? Recent figures indicate that there is more gender parity in the infection. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the infection rate is 1.2 men per 1.0 women. Men may be more likely to contract the disease in a severe manner, which requires their transfer to hospital. Doctor Li Chang of the Jintan Hospital said that “low female exposure to viral infection can be attributed to protection from the X chromosome and sex hormones that play an important role in immunity.”

According to recent Internet search results, some people are apparently confusing coronavirus — a pneumonia-like illness that has sickened around 6,000 and killed more than 130 — with Corona , the light Mexican pale lager.

As seen in a Google Trends graph first shared by BoingBoing , there has been a major spike in searches for “Corona beer virus” in North America, Brazil, Australia and parts of Asia and Europe, suggesting people are concerned about whether or not the beverage is to blame for the recent viral outbreak.
Fortunately, at least one Twitter user was there to help clear up the confusion with a helpful graph. Advertisement
Anheuser-Busch InBev, which counts Corona among its brands, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the confusion, although it's safe to say that Corona — which is indeed a beer, and not a respiratory illness — is not associated with the coronavirus outbreak.

To protect yourself against the virus , the CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with dirty hands. Also, avoid close contact with sick people and cover your nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing.
However, the CDC did not specifically disclose if drinking beer was a preventative measure.

Coronavirus: 'Unprecedented' demand for food packages as Kiwis struggle during COVID-19 lockdown. 	"With more Kiwis struggling financially due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, foodbanks are under increasing pressure, the Salvation Army says.
The charity released its latest monitoring report on Friday, revealing the demand for food during the lockdown had risen sharply.
""The scale of the need that we're seeing is absolutely massive,"" the report's editor Ronji Tanielu told The AM Show.
In one week earlier this month, the organisation gave out 5895 food parcels - a 346 percent rise from the week before the lockdown began.
""That's equivalent to what we would usually give out in a month,"" said Tanielu ""This is just unprecedented, it's huge, it's challenging, really challenging - for us and for other social services as well.""

'Layoffs are coming': Economist warns unemployment set to 'surge', house prices to fall
Tourism job cuts a 'horror story' - Queenstown Mayor The report comes as the country's economy faces its toughest time for almost a century.
Experts have predicted the fallout from COVID-19 will be worse than the global financial crisis of 2008 and become to the Great Depression.
Economist Cameron Bagrie earlier this month estimated the unemployment rate is likely to be around 6.5 percent currently and would continue to ""surge"" as the effect of the pandemic was more widely felt.
Tanielu said the Salvation Army was being ""bombarded"" by people needing assistance, not just by those who normally were in need of help, but also by people on temporary work visas unable to receive Government assistance and by the newly unemployed.
One of the ""major concerns"" the organisation had was there was ""potentially a new group of people that are entering vulnerability"", said Tanielu - ""those who have never used the foodbank before, those who have never had Government income support before.""
The sharp rise in demand has meant the Salvation Army is battling to keep up.
""We are struggling. I think many foodbanks are struggling.""
Tanielu said despite the hard times many Kiwis are facing, there has also been an outpouring of generosity, with Kiwis contributing $1.7 million to the charity's Foodbank Project.

Cecil College transitions programs due to COVID-19. 	"Like many organizations, the COVID-19 virus hit Cecil College hard — and forced a change in how the school was delivering its in-person instruction.
Luckily, the school was prepared, and has used the shutdown caused by the virus to not only continue its instructional program, but also to generate new ideas for the future.
The college already had an online learning management system, according to Vice-President of Academic Programs Dr. Christy Dryer. This allowed the school to make the necessary transition to a completely distance learning concept at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown.
Online instruction
The school uses an online learning portal called Blackboard, common at many higher learning institutes. Dryer said the program provides a context for every course at the college, and that the software has been in place for several years.
One of the programs in Blackboard is Collaborate, which is a virtual classroom that professors and students can use to replicate an in-person classroom environment. Other programs include Respondus, an online test monitoring system and SoftChalk, which allows professors to create online lessons that have videos, gaming and quizzes embedded in the software.
Dryer said the school also already had an online writing lab, known as OWL.
“We also put in place a professional development for online teaching course,” Dryer said.
“In order to teach online, you have to have experience online, some formal education in online teaching or they had to take the course.”
Dryer said before COVID-19 struck, many faculty members took the online course.
“We felt uniquely positioned with a lot of the pieces in place to meet this,” Dryer said, adding that in addition to the many online programs and feature the college has at its disposal, many courses already had both online and in-person offerings and many degrees were awarded for online and in-person work.
‘Everything we needed was already there’
Associate Business Professor Adele Foltz said she felt very prepared to teach online in part due to the college’s PDOT class, which she described as wonderful.
She said professors had ample time to prepare to move in-person courses to an all online format as a forewarning of the impending closure occurred before the college’s spring break that ran from March 16-21. Foltz said that professors had the entire week of spring break to prepare for the change.
Foltz said in making the transition from face-to-face instruction to online teaching, she began looking at the technology she had and what she would need to transfer her classes.
“Everything we needed was already there in the Blackboard software, I just had to implement it,” she said.
Using the software
Foltz gave the Whig an online demonstration and allowed this reporter to work through the Blackboard software as a student might. During the video presentation, Foltz was standing in front of a traditional whiteboard, and she outlined how she could teach a class using the whiteboard in a similar was to an in person class.
She also noted that the Blackboard Collaborate software as a whiteboard that can be shared with the student on the student’s own computer. She noted that her students have found the whiteboard to be helpful in learning the material.
Foltz also said the additional benefit of the software is that the lessons can be recorded, giving the students the opportunity to go back and watch the video if they either missed a portion of the lesson or might have been having an issue with some of the material presented.
“It has been pretty well received by students,” she said.
Flexibility is key in online instruction
One of the most important aspects in the delivery of information online has been the ability to remain flexible, Foltz said.
Some students, due to their family situations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, have a harder time working and studying from home. Foltz said professors have had to be innovative to be able to continue to deliver the material in a way that works for all students.
“These courses include the same objectives, same rigor and same experience through Collaborate that students receive in person,” she said.
The online experience can also be tailored in many respects to mirror an in person experience, Foltz noted.
For instance, students can not only interact with the professor, they can even interact with each other during a class. During her presentation, Foltz pointed out that a student can even raise their hand by clicking an icon that looks like a person raising their hand, this sends a tone to Foltz that she can hear and then recognize the student who is answering the question. In this way, other students can hear questions being raised by their fellow students in much the same way an in person class might be conducted.
One interesting feature Foltz pointed out in the software is the ability to send polling questions or other questions to students as group during the class. She said that while the tool has been quite useful in online learning she intends to incorporate the concept when in person classes are able to resume. She said she felt that her student’s access to her is 10 times better with the software than it might have been before, even with respect to in person classes because of all of the hands-on training she is able to do with the software.
Digital access remains an issue
The only complaints Dryer said the school has heard from students is that some students have limited access or limited wifi capabilities.
Also, some students have had difficulties initially using the technology. Dryer said health care students’ normal curriculum would have them working with patients, rather than doing simulations online.
As for the technical issues, the college has been working closely with students to resolve connectivity issues as well as helping students who have had problems learning to use the technology.
“I think overall what I am hearing from our students is they are pleasantly surprised and staying engaged,” Dryer said.
Dryer said that while it is too early to know specifics relating to how the college might be able to use lessons learned during the COVID-19 shutdown for the future she did say that school officials are learning in a much more expeditious way than they might have otherwise how efficient the college can be in delivering its educational programs to its student. She said it helps expand what the college can do online going forward and helps to enhance all of the school’s programs overall.
“Once we get out of [the shutdown], there will be some programming that changes and some course delivery models that change permanently,” she said.
“We will always have in-person classes no matter what, as everything doesn’t translate to online learning. For instance, there is only so much virtual learning you can do in health care.”
Dryer said through this process she has received some amazing emails from faculty members about creative things they are doing in their classes.
“I have worked at Cecil for a very long time and I have always been proud,” she said. “I don’t think I have ever been as proud as I am right now.”
Cecil College President Mary Way Bolt provided a written statement on how the school has adjusted during this trying time.
“Cecil College has always been, and will remain, united in our dedication to provide the quality education and resources necessary for our students to succeed,” Bolt said.
“Now, more than ever, we have harnessed that spirit to swiftly respond to the COVID-19 crisis with the innovation and rapid problem solving paramount to ensuring that student learning is not interrupted and that each of our Seahawks feel 100 percent supported by us.”"
"""Something's Not Right Here Folks""​ | A Look at USA 2009 H1N1 Virus Compared to China 2020 Corona Virus. "	"Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. ""What about..."" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: ""The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections."" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. It's impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut. Mario Cavolo, Shenyang. "
CDC issues new COVID-19 guidance to pet owners after 2 NY cats test positive. 	"The Center for Disease Control is issuing new guidance to pet owners after two cats tested positive for COVID19 here in New York State. The two cats are the first U.S. pets to test positive for the virus.
While only one of the cats lived in a household where anyone tested positive for COVID19, it’s believed that the virus spread from the humans to their pets.
The felines are not the first to test positive for the virus, tigers at the Bronx Zoo caught the virus after one of their handlers was infected with COVID19.
“Felines as a species are probably more apt to get the virus from people but we’ve seen so few cases of that that it’s really to early to predict what that’s going to be,” said Todd Whilen, the Medical Director at Pittsford Animal Hospital.
As of now there are no known cases of cats infecting humans.
“This is a zoonotic disease, a disease that is spread from animals to people and so we’ve got to think that virus has the potential to go in the reverse,” said Whilen.
Routine animal testing for Covid19 is not recommended. Partly because positive cases in pets are rare, and partly because the tests are notoriously difficult to get even for humans.
Any decision about testing a pet would need to be made with both the State Veterinarian and public health officials.
“We’re going to leave that up to the State Veterinarian to decide who is going to be tested and for what reasons,” said Whilen.
The CDC is issuing new guidance to protect both pets and their owners. But the bottom line according to Dr. Whilen is to make sure your social distancing with your pet.
“Treat your pet as if it was a person in terms of social distancing and contact with other people and pets. Keepthem indoors as much as possible. And be super cautious when you have someone positive with COVID in the house,” said Whilen.
The CDC also recommends the following.
Do not let pets interact with people or other pets outside of your household. Keep cats indoors whenever possible. Walk a dog on a leash maintaining 6 feet of distance between other people and pets. Avoid places like dog parks where social distancing is difficult to maintain. If you or anyone else in your household is sick with COVID19, the CDC recommends the following…
When possible have another family member care for your pets until you are better. Avoid contact with your pet including petting, bedding, or sharing food. If you must care for a pet while sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after interacting with pets. The @CDCgov is issuing new guidance for pet owners after 2 cats in New York tested positive for #covid19 ."
Corona Virus Is God Telling Us Something. 	"Leviticus 11
Meat you can eat:
You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud.
Fish must have scales and fins.
Things you can not eat:
No shellfish, like lobster, crabs or oysters
In the book of Leviticus make, s it clear what to eat and not eat.
Yes, this comes from the Old Testament, but they did not have all the sickness, viruses and diseases
Today, man will eat anything. Look what is happening in the world today.
The Corona Virus is spreading around the world, and Governments don't seem to concern. People are still flying from China to other countries. Governments are telling us not to worry, as people are die everyday.
In China they sell all types of animals out in the open. Was this what God was trying to tell us? We are not eating what God told us to eat.
Might want to start reading the Bible, and start living the way God tells us to live.
This type of virus will always be around, because the world has turned their back on God.

Corona virus Is Biological Warfare Weapon. 	Technocrat scientists around the world are using CRISPR technology in top-secret labs to develop doomsday-type biological warfare weapons. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is such a center, and the most likely source of the coronavirus outbreak. TN does not endorse either GreatGameIndia or Dr. Francis Boyle, but the globalist censorship is notable and significant. For instance, the globalist publication, Foreign Policy , strongly refuted the “conspiracy theory” on January 29 with the headline, The Wuhan Virus Is Not a Lab-Made Bioweapon , and attacked GreatGameIndia and ZeroHedge in particular. ZeroHedge has been permanently banned from Twitter. ⁃ TN Editor In an explosive interview Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act has given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire , Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped. He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring. Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia ‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked. Watch Dr. Francis Boyle’s interview with Geopolitics and Empire below: Dr. Boyle’s position is in stark contrast to the mainstream media’s narrative of the virus being originated from the seafood market, which is increasingly being questioned by many experts. Recently, American Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas also dismantled the mainstream media’s claim on Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals. In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion. Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining mainstream media’s claim.“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said.“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.” Such concerns have also been raised by J.R. Nyquist , the well known author of the books “ Origins of the Fourth World War ” and “ The Fool and His Enemy ,” as well as co-author of “ The New Tactics of Global War ”. In his insightful article he published secret speechs given to high-level Communist Party cadres by Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian explaining a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance – the catalyst for which would be China’s secret plan to weaponiz viruses . Nyquist gave three different data points for making his case in analyzing Coronavirus. He writes: The third data point worth considering: the journal GreatGameIndia has published a piece titled “ Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.”

Anyone watching FR already knows most of what Amir is saying about the virus. He gets it. As most folks on this site do.
Also comments on the so-called Deal of the Century, which is really a plan for Israel, not any kind of give-and-take in the usual, historical sense of these agreements; military action in Syria; the new and possibly temporary friendliness of Sudan; the present position of Russia; and more.

Corona Lockdown Fallout. 	France’s Total Rejects Force Majeure Notice From Chinese LNG Buyer French oil major Total has rejected a force majeure notice from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyer in China, the first global energy supplier to publicly push back against firms backing out of deals amid the coronavirus outbreak. Concerns that Chinese companies could back out of contracts because of the coronavirus epidemic have slowed down spot crude oil and LNG sales into China, the world’s top energy consumer, increasing global supplies and depressing prices of energy products. “Some Chinese customers, at least one, are trying to use the coronavirus to say I have force majeure,” Philippe Sauquet, head of Total’s gas, renewables and power segment, said during the company’s full-year results presentation on Thursday. “We have received one force majeure that we have rejected.” Companies invoke force majeure when they cannot meet their contractual obligations because of circumstances beyond their control. Sauquet did not disclose the name of the buyer Total rejected a force majeure notice from. Reuters reported on Thursday that China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the country’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has declared force majeure on some prompt deliveries with at least three suppliers because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus, two sources said on Thursday. Total is one of the biggest suppliers of LNG to CNOOC, industry sources said. Last week, a Chinese international trade promotion agency said it would offer force majeure certificates to companies struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic to give to their overseas partners. Lawyers told Reuters that LNG contracts are typically governed by English law which spell out events that constitute a force majeure and some may include the epidemic clause. Serving the force majeure notice is the first step in a long-drawn out process, they said. The onus is also on buyers to prove that they are not physically able to receive the cargo to demonstrate a force majeure. For instance, if there are port closures or if workers are unable to get to the ports due to the virus. I love lines like: ““There is absolutely no need to panic buy..” , because what’s the other side of that? You can trust us to tell you when there’s a need to panic? But a government could never tell you to panic. Best version is “This is not the time to panic” . And then you go: Okay, I’ll watch some TV then, and I’ll make sure I get my ten hours of sleep. But first thing in the morning…. Panic Buying As Hong Kong Government Silent On Coming Quarantine Move Anxious Hongkongers scrambled on Thursday to stock up on essentials over fears that border restrictions to contain the coronavirus would choke off shipments, while the government provided scant details on the mandatory quarantine taking effect in less than 36 hours on arrivals from mainland China. As long queues formed at shops all over the city for the second straight day and people jostled to grab toilet and tissue paper, as well as rice and perishables, food suppliers sought to assure the public there was no need for hoarding. “There is absolutely no need to panic buy. We have always worked to ensure a stable supply of food and all these years, throughout all sorts of big events, we have never had a shortage,” Thomas Ng Wing-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Food Council, told a press conference. The fears, fed by online rumours, mounted when the government announced on Wednesday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering from mainland China, sparking concerns that supplies would also be held up. But while the government said it would reveal more on the quarantine measures on Thursday, the day ended with no information forthcoming, as sources told the Post that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was still locked in meetings over facilities and details on implementation. Even as they gave assurances, representatives of rice, pork, egg, seafood, poultry and fruit-and-vegetable merchants urged the government to exempt cross-border truck drivers from the 14-day quarantine set to kick in on Saturday, to avert any delays in supplies reaching the city.

Coronavirus Kills ‘Hero’ Chinese Doctor Who Sounded Alarm A Chinese doctor who tried to warn the world about a new coronavirus died of the disease on Friday, prompting an outpouring of sorrow as the death toll passed 630 and Beijing declared a “people’s war” on the rapidly spreading pathogen. Li Wenliang, 34, died in the early hours of the morning at the hospital where he worked and first raised the alarm about the new coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, hospital officials said. An ophthalmologist, Li was one of eight people reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading “illegal and false” information about the coronavirus, a flu-like pathogen that since triggered a global health emergency. His messages to a group of doctors on Chinese social media warning of a new “SARS-like” coronavirus – a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 – triggered the wrath of Wuhan police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. He was forced to sign a letter on Jan. 3 saying he had “severely disrupted social order” and was threatened with criminal charges. The story of how China announced the death of Dr Li Wenliang & then allegedly told doctors to put his body on life support & say he was ‘critical’. A grotesque end to the story of a brave man who tried to warn about the coronavirus & has now died from it.

Intel withdraws 2020 forecast on ‘significant’ uncertainty caused by Covid-19 pandemic. 	The world’s largest semiconductor maker reported a 23 per cent jump in first-quarter revenue and better-than-projected profit \n But its profit outlook fell short of estimates, sparking concerns that a spending slowdown will drag on business for the rest of 2020 \n Semiconductor maker Intel saw a jump in first-quarter revenue and better-than-projected profit, bolstered by demand from companies getting employees to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic. Intel withdrew its full-year sales forecast, citing “significant economic uncertainty” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic . The company’s shares fell more than 5 per cent in late trading. The world’s largest semiconductor maker reported a 23 per cent jump in first-quarter revenue and better-than-projected profit, bolstered by demand for chips that run the laptops and server machines companies need to keep people working from home. Though it gave an optimistic second-quarter sales target, Intel’s profit outlook fell short of estimates, sparking concerns that a spending slowdown will drag on business for the rest of 2020. Sales in the current period will be about US$18.5 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated US$18.08 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income will be about US$1.04 a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of US$1.11. “Investors were caught off guard” by the profit forecast, Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co., said. “When they’re crushing it on the top line but whiffing pretty hard on the earnings, it’s a shock.” Companies have reacted to coronavirus shelter-in-place orders by buying more laptops to keep employees working remotely. At the same time, data centre owners have responded to a surge in videoconferencing, social-media use and movie streaming by stocking up on pricey Intel processors that run server machines. Those trends fuelled a 14 per cent increase in PC-related chip sales in the first quarter, and a 43 per cent gain in the company’s data centre division. Intel, Lenovo and BGI are working to crack the coronavirus genome Still, the soaring first-quarter sales fed into concerns that demand may have peaked early in the year, with Intel and its customers girding for the worst recession since the 2008 financial crisis. In the report, the chip maker said it expects weaker demand from government and corporate clients in the second half of 2020. “The second half demand picture is more uncertain,” chief executive officer Bob Swan said during a conference call with analysts. For Intel’s PC chip business, the economic slowdown will outweigh demand from the work-from-home trend, the company said. The data centre division will benefit from continued chip purchases by large cloud providers, it added. The company suspended share repurchases in late March and did not reinstate buy-backs on Thursday. It also sold US$10 billion of debt recently to give itself a financial cushion if needed, chief financial officer George Davis said in an interview following the results. “At some point we’re going to see the recession start to impact demand for PCs,” Davis told analysts on the conference call. Intel is already seeing the impact on automotive customers and the Internet-of-Things business, he added. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will suffer in the second quarter as Intel increases production of new chips. That will be reversed when those products go on sale in the second half, he said. First-quarter sales climbed to US$19.8 billion, the chip maker said. Analysts on average had predicted US$18.83 billion. Net income was US$5.7 billion, or US$1.31 a share, compared with per-share estimates for US$1.23. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, widened to 60.6 per cent in the quarter. Intel shares, which closed at US$59.04 in New York, dropped as low as US$55.26 following the earnings report. The stock is down about 1 per cent for 2020.
Kobe, Earthquakes, Corona Virus: Who run tings”. Only God. So we thank Him for Grace and Mercy each day. 	"One of the popular views of 21st Century man is captured, perhaps only in a way that Jamaican street talk can: “ We run tings, tings no run we”. In the sense that due to advance in science and technology, and information widely available – on YouTube presumably for example – we are more in control of our destiny now than ever before. And of course, religion, and in particular the Christian religion which advances the notion that God is Sovereign over all things, and even more contentious, that Jesus is Savior, gets a “push back” in this new age. A discussion I am told, as I have not yet read the book, but I intend to, has been ‘stirred up’, by the book Sapiens, in the UK, and other “ advanced societies’.
Until an earthquake comes along and “ the domino game mash up”! Or as one of former Prime Ministers, gifted with the unique ability to get to the heart of the matter with a pithy phrase would say, “ argument done”. For who in Jamaica thought “ a me run tings” this week? Certainly not me, or all those with whom I have discussed the rumbling, shaking, seemingly never ending earthquake which shook Jamaica and The Cayman Islands and even downtown Miami – the longest one I’ve ever experienced – 7.7 on the Ritcher Scale this week; less than the one which destroyed Port Royal centuries ago, and the one which devastated Haiti in more recent times. Who took up their phone and asked google or watched a YouTube video, “ how to survive an earthquake”? Me? “ Mercy Lord. Mercy”! Escaped involuntarily from my lips. And then I went and stood under a door jam. And was about to depart the building when the shaking mercifully ended!
Until – what was I doing when I heard moment occurred – my wife said “have you heard the news about Kobe”. “ “What news “was my response! Then I joined the rest of the world in shock and mourning, literally, as BasketBall thanks to the NBA promotion, is a global game. And Kobe was a global superstar. A seemingly routine helicopter flight, which was a way of life for Kobe for many years, turned tragic, and nine precious souls perished . In moment! And we wonder, “ what is man”. And not “ who run tings”.
But the story of this tumultuous week of drama, did not end there. For next up was the Corona Virus and the heartbreaking plea from “ a child of Jamaica “ to rescue her from the nightmare and impending disaster in Wuhan China, the epicenter of the outbreak. She was starving, scared, alone and almost going out of her mind with worry, as reported on Dionne Jackson Miller’s popular News Program Beyond the Headlines on RadioJamaica FM 94 – hope I got the new name right. And repeated the next day on Hotline on the same station, by another well known host, Emily Shields; among with other issues raised by “ Walking Shop” and “ Comrade” et al! No! A thousand times no. She did not run tings. Nor do we here in Jamaica as we try to grapple with this Global Emergency as declared by the WHO this week. Do we have any idea of how tiny these viruses are which can, and have turned upside down, the lives of millions of people, like the Bubonic plague of yesteryear , and the worldwide Influenza epidemic of more recent times? So who really run tings?
I’ll give you a clue:
“For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was preached to you.”
1 Peter 1:24-25 NIV
https://www.bible.com/111/1pe.1.24-25.niv
Only the Word of God endures forever. And so I turned to the Word of God, prior to, and after the “ the week that shook up the world”. And wrote these messages. To my church and on facebook:
EMAIL TO THE CHURCH
Old Testament
Malachi 3:1-4
Thus says the Lord, See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight– indeed, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?
For he is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the Lord in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years.
Deep in my sleep this song came into my heart last night:
O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee;
I give thee back the life I owe,
that in thine ocean depths its flow
may richer fuller be….
Then I read the OT reading reading for next Sunday. And wondered if we really understand that the prophetic Word reveled in the Malachi passage. Which by the way is exactly what John the Baptist said, “ After me will come one who will baptize…..with fire”. Who indeed can “ endure the day of the coming of the Lord”.
Part of the challenge that the church faces in this and every age, is the secularization of the mystical “body of Christ”. The infiltration into the church of infantile understanding of Christ, viz, “ Gentle Jesus meek and mild”. And not the Jesus who came to “ purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and present us “ holy to the Lord”. I would suggest that, in this context, we read again the famous passage in Hebrews:
“Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness.”
Hebrews 12:7-10 NIV
https://www.bible.com/111/heb.12.7-10.niv
Yes! Jesus came to make us holy unto the Lord. To discipline us, so that in Him, and only in Him, we are made “ righteous “ in the sight of God. To refine us, with fire, and not just to “Call a church into being”.
And the thing to consider this morning, is that “ such love” wilt not let us go, until, we “ give back the life we owe”, so that “ in thine ocean depths, its flow may richer fuller be”. More than we can ask or imagine! So the Christian life is one of continual ‘letting go” of self, and daily dying to self, on the one hand. And on the other hand, is the mighty work of the “ Holy Spirit”, Who wilt not let us go, until our life becomes one with God. Filled with His Spirit to do the good works which He has prepared us to do, even when we were in our mother’s womb. Like Jeremiah! And Isaiah. And John the Baptist.
So the Christian life is one of discipline, and not doing our own thing. So that we may be presented holy to the Lord one fine day. In the same way next Sunday we celebrate Jesus being presented to God – the Gospel reading.
In the midst of the discipline we can then appreciate the third verse of that glorious hymn:
O Joy that sleekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heat to thee:
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
and feel the promise that is not vain,
that morn shall tearless be.
And perhaps even more importantly even though it is one narrative:
O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee:
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
and from the ground there blossoms red
life that shall endless be.
For the ultimate goal of the Christian life, is not one of relief from trials, and protection from the earthquakes and hurricanes of life, but rather the promise of “life that shall endless be”.
I pray God that day by day, we accept this truth, and become renewed, and not fall prey to eloquent speech, “ lest the Cross of Christ lose its power”. And as the church is renewed so may the nation(s) may be renewed.
Pray God that all who died this week, in Christ, including Kobe Bryant and his daughter, and hopefully others in that tragic crash, shall receive the promise of “ life that shall endless be”. For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and be celebrated on CNN, and yet lose his soul.
A life presented to God in Christ. A life that, even in this troubled world, is becoming “ in thine ocean depths, one that is richer and fuller”, and helps to spread abroad the love of God, “ that wilt not let anyone go”.
That same love that declares through his prophet Ezekiel: Does the Lord take any pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn and be saved.
The same love manifest in Jesus on the Cross in fulfillment of the Prophetic Word; For God so loved the world……..
Thank God that He was pleased not to destroy us by earthquake yesterday, even as wickedness – how can you kill a child in cold blood – continues to stalk the land. Thank God for the continued witness of the faithful ones ..who dare not ask to fly from the Cross.
Peace and in obedience.

Obedience is hugely important, but only when it comes from a relationship of trust in God. It cannot be a means to get to God, because it places far too much stock in the human effort and ignores the enormity both of sin and of God’s grace. Obedience itself cannot lead to God because it is based on the our capacities, and we don’t have the capacity to obey perfectly. Faith on the other hand is based on the mercy and grace of an eternal Being -Chris Tiegreen.
So we thank God for mercy this week, and mourn with those who mourn. But we do not mourn like those who have no hope, and think that they run tings. But mourn in the certain hope that in Christ Jesus, Kobe and his daughter who from all reports were practicing Christians, attending mass as Roman Catholics and participated in Holy Communion ( and pray God the other seven person who died in the crash) they are safe in the hands of the One who promised Eternal Life. Like Forever and ever.
For like it or not, and believe it or not, this life here on Terra Firma, ironically is not very firm at all, but just one phase of life. For Homo Sapiens, in Christ, for those who believe, are promised a life where there is no Corona Virus, and no tears for Kobe or anyone else, and no earthquakes. Just Peace, perfect peace, with the God Who made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that is it in. For it is He and only He that really “ run tings”. So we thank the God who run tings for His grace and mercy each day!"
Basic facts about the corona virus. 	"Basic facts about the corona virus Hiding the truth in plain sight Deliberately engineered hysteria
How can you tell the news media is lying?
Their lips are moving.
This video is about simple, non-hysterical fact they’re not telling you.
Wuhan is the capital of the most polluted province in the most polluted country in the world.
Air pollution is so bad there that people COMMONLY wear face masks just getting to and from work.
The particles are so thick they create visibility problems like a thick fog and there is a persistent burning smell in the air.
And this has been going on for many, many years. Last year – before the flu – it was so bad that the US State Department issued a warning to travelers.
Warning: Wearing these masks without replacing them daily is a very good way to make yourself sick.

Volition Files Patent for Nu.Q(TM) COVID-19 Triage Test and Commences Proof of Concept Studies. 	"VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) (""Volition"") today announced that it is actively developing a COVID-19 triage test aiming to predict the likelihood that an individual who is COVID-19 positive will develop complications and severe disease, using its propriety Nu.Q TM platform. The goal of the test is to provide early insight into which patients may require higher levels of monitoring including hospitalization and critical care resources, versus those who will not develop serious symptoms. Preliminary studies of patients with COVID-19 infection are now underway in hospitals in Belgium and Germany with results expected this quarter.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMEX:VNRX. Click here to check it out. AMEX:VNRX AMEX:VNRX AMEX:VNRX
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pneumonia are associated with highly elevated production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) by white blood cells. NETs are made of nucleosomes and can be detected in minute quantities in the blood using Volition's Nu.Q TM nucleosome assays which Volition believes may, therefore, predict the progression of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and complications including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients.
Dr. Jason Terrell , Chief Medical Officer at Volition commented, ""The current COVID-19 pandemic has tragically caused many deaths and is overwhelming healthcare resources around the world. Early identification and triaging of patients who are the most likely to deteriorate and need critical care from those unlikely to develop serious disease would enable both improved outcomes for patients and improved use of critical care resources for healthcare providers.""
Volition is working with collaborators to investigate whether existing Nu.Q TM epigenetic assays can predict which patients with COVID-19 are most at risk. A test that can successfully identify the patients that will need hospitalization or respiratory support would help to provide care for those most in need before they become critically ill and to maximize the best use of critical care beds. Subject to successful results from these initial proof of concept studies currently underway, Volition plans to conduct further studies using its fully automated Nu.Q TM assay platform to ascertain the best use of these tests in different healthcare systems worldwide.
Jake Micallef , Chief Scientific Officer at Volition commented, ""Whilst cancer remains our core disease focus, Volition's existing Nu.Q TM epigenetic toolbox may have potential to help doctors and patients in the COVID-19 pandemic or in future respiratory viral outbreaks. We have filed a novel patent for the utilisation of our Nu.Q TM epigenetic platform for the triaging of COVID-19 sufferers. I am looking forward to the results of these trials, and indeed future trials, with the aim of developing a clinically useful product to triage COVID-19 patients worldwide.""
For further details please contact [email protected]
The Science Behind Nu.Q TM and COVID-19
White blood cells help protect the body against infection. White cells engulf invading viruses and bacteria and produce antibodies against them. In addition, white cells also eject chromatin material out of the cell to form NETs which catch and trap invading viruses. In a respiratory infection, white cells migrate to the lungs to protect them from the virus. However, SARS and pneumonia are associated with an inappropriate hyperimmune response to the virus involving massive ejection of NETs into the blood by white blood cells which is highly damaging to the lungs. The ejected NETs material is made up of nucleosomes which can be detected in minute quantities using Volition's Nu.Q TM nucleosome assays. Volition is now testing this clinically to determine whether elevated NETs levels in the blood are predictive of complications arising from viral infection such as COVID-19.
Volition has not yet successfully developed a triage test for COVID-19 and is in investigational stages only.
About Volition
Volition is a multi-national epigenetics company developing simple, easy to use, cost effective blood tests to help diagnose a range of cancers and other diseases. Early diagnosis has the potential to not only prolong the life of patients, but also to improve their quality of life. The tests are based on the science of Nucleosomics TM , which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid - an indication that disease is present. Volition is primarily focused on human diagnostics but also has a subsidiary focused on animal diagnostics.
Volition's research and development activities are centered in Belgium , with additional offices in Texas , London and Singapore , as the company focuses on bringing its diagnostic products to market."
Hot water is good to contra virus corona. 	"Friends passed on-
 My classmate's uncle and nephew, graduated with a master's degree, and work in Shenzhen Hospital. He is being transferred to study Wuhan pneumonia virus. He just called me and told me to tell my friends: If you have a runny nose and sputum when you have a cold, you cannot be a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, because coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose. This is the simplest way to identify. Please tell your friends that if you know more about medical knowledge, you will have more awareness of identification and prevention. Dean Reference

 This time, the Wuhan virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed at a temperature of 26-27 degrees. Therefore, drink more hot water. You can tell your friends and relatives to drink more hot water to prevent it.
 It has been cold recently, and drinking hot water is also very comfortable. It is not a cure and is good for the body. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink ice, remember!"

CHRISTIANS PREACHING ON STREETS OF CHINA CORONA VIRUS HOT ZONE !!!. 	"Christians at the centre of China virus outbreak still preaching on streets

As if rallying around the apostles’ declaration that “We must serve God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), Christians have continued to boldly share the Gospel in the streets of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
Witnesses who share their faith openly not only face possible infection from the dangerous respiratory disease caused by the virus, but also could be subject to potential persecution by authorities, as well.
Despite the potential dangers, CBN News Asia correspondent Lucille Talusan reports that Christians in Wuhan are meeting needs created by the crisis and by doing so are creating opportunities to share the Gospel.
The believers, often operating underground to avoid persecution and prosecution by Communist authorities, are taking advantage of the need for surgical masks. In addition to helping prevent contracting the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus, the masks also help shield the identity of the witness.
Talusan reported that a “very courageous” group of Christians in Wuhan have hit the streets to distribute the protective facemasks. As they hand out the masks, Talusan said, “They say that they are Christians and they share the love of Christ and point to Jesus to bring hope to them and their families and the whole of China. … This is really a breakthrough.”
Talusan said that the uncertainty of the crisis has helped heighten the receptiveness to the message of Christ.
A video shared by Father Francis Liu from Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness shows that encouraging sermons are being broadcasted to their communities through speakers placed on balconies.
A Christian rode his bike to a pharmacy where people gathered and played a sermon through a portable speaker, according to International Christian Concern.

Pastor Huang Lei from Wuhan’s Root and Fruit Church published an article on January 24, saying, “While the real situation is possibly more severe and complicated than what is known, regardless of what circumstances we are in, we should not worry and fear all the disasters, pandemic, and death, ‘because He is the Lord of our lives. If He does not allow [it to happen], we will not even have a single hair fall out from our heads.’”
Pastor Tan Songhua from Wuhan Cornerstone Church also told his congregation that although they face trials of faith and personal safety, Jesus only has “plans to prosper you and not to harm you (Jeremiah 29:11).” He then called on Christians to pray for this city, and bring the peace of Christ to everyone.
While the Chinese Communist government includes Christianity-based Catholicism and Protestantism among the nation’s five officially sanctioned religions, activities of these faith traditions require registration and are subject to complex state-regulatory agencies that manage “all aspects of religious life, including religious leadership appointments, selection of clergy, and interpretation of doctrine,” according to the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

Corona Virus, The Black Death & California. 	"After considering the the Chinese source and spread of the Corona Virus I must conclude that disease is only a very minor threat to the peoples of this world. On the base of the population exposed-to and contracting and dying of that disorder it is much more a subject for poof-pieces by media seeking attention than any real risk of a pandemic.
Now, you should consider the Bubonic Plague ( aka ""Black Death"") which once killed up to 60% of the population of Europe and inflicted like mortality in other places.
With very early diagnosis (Most of the USA's physicians do not have the training to readily identify the early stages of that disease) and intensive treatment, the most common form of The Plague has a mortality rate of ~15%. Even with such diagnosis-and-treatment some forms of that disease kills almost 100% of infected persons.
In the USA there are places ( eg About the ""Four Corners"" part of the Southwestern States, Denver's parks AND San Francisco ) which have seen outbreaks of The Black Death. The last locus may be due to: Travelers from plague-active areas of China or India; And, its spread by fleas living on rats. As there is now (In filth encrusted San Francisco and other parts of California) plagues of rats [ I have not seen any scientific (Valid and reliable) studies as to flea populations among rats in California. ]
As far as I know there is NO vaccine to protect us from The Plague.
Are our governments honest and active enough to deal with an outbreak of ""The Black Death"" in, for example, California?

Naveen Jindal reveals that JSPL's steel exports have spiked since Covid-19 outbreak. 	"BCCL Indian steel exports exceeded imports by 18% in FY 2020, registering strong growth after a slow start.
The Coronavirus crisis could benefit the Indian steel industry further as Chinese ports are blocked. Indian steel makers could use this as an opportunity to increase their exports to Southeast Asia which relies on supplies from China.
Leading Indian steel company Jindal Steel and Power said that a majority of its steel exports are going to China, suggesting a reversal of trend wherein China was said to be dumping its steel in India.
In an interesting turn of events, leading steel manufacturer Jindal Steel and Power is now exporting 80% of its steel production. A majority of these exports are going to China, which is currently trying to get its economy back on track after being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Indian steel industry has had a rollercoaster run in the last few years.
According to data provided by the Ministry of Steel, India had imported excessively between 2015 and 2016. It became a net exporter in FY2017 and 2018. In FY 2019, the balance turned in favour of imports yet again.
Here’s how India has exported and imported steel in FY 2020
According to government data , India has been a net exporter of steel with exports exceeding imports by 18% in FY2020. Gaining from this trend reversal is one of India’s leading manufacturers - Jindal Steel, with a capacity of 6.55 million tonne per annum (MTPA).
“Right now, we are exporting 80% of the steel that we are producing, and the majority of that is going to China,” Naveen Jindal , chairman of JSPL told Business Insider.
He further revealed that his company’s steel plants are operating at 75-80% capacity in the last two months. “All the time we say that China has been dumping steel in India, but right now we are able to export to China,” he quipped.
Jindal is betting on construction activity picking up to improve its sales in India
Though its export market has improved, the shutdown of businesses in India is affecting JSPL too.
In 2020, Jindal Steel and Power’s stock peaked on February 6 at ₹197.75. Since then, it has seen a massive crash, plummeting to as low as ₹63.20 on April 3. It has slowly picked up since the crash, but it is still more than 50% down from its February peak.
To improve his domestic sales, Jindal is banking on construction activity resuming after the end of lockdown.
“Before monsoons, people like to complete their civil constructions. We hope that these kinds of constructions will start (after lockdown ends),” Jindal said."

And the available information is only the preliminary information, must be studied further In the case that it is specified that the patient has returned to the infection repeatedly Usually, the nature of the virus If this is not the case, it will not be returned in a short period of time, such as the 2009 flu case. However, the corona virus is a new infection, it must be followed. ""As for the results of two taxi driver surveillance criteria, in the afternoon of January 31, a committee of 3 divisions namely epidemiology, lab and virology. Both cases will be imported into the meeting before finalizing the results. It is expected that once the conclusion is made, the ministry's executives will inform the details. But from the initial symptoms check, both cases improved. However, if there is a person-to-person infection, it's not uncommon. Because now it is found that some countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, the United States and Vietnam have found human-to-human infection, ""said the Director General of the Communicable Disease Division. Dr. Sanphong Ritthaksa, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Traditional and Alternative Medicine said that for people who are not sick But want to prevent infection, in addition to wearing a mask made of hot eating cloths, use a spoon and wash your hands regularly Can also use andrographis paniculata Helps stimulate the immune system But this protection is not necessary to do everyone. General strong people, just drink a lot of water Get enough rest Avoid the risk of infection."
COVID-19 Pet Testing Not Recommended. 	"In response to two cats in New York testing positive for COVID-19, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) does not recommend pet owners or animal shelters test most animals. While testing cats and dogs for COVID-19 is now available through some veterinary industry and diagnostic labs, the tests should only be done in very specific situations in which all three criteria below are met: 1. Your pet has direct exposure (live in the same household) to a known COVID-19 positive person. 2. Your pet is showing signs of respiratory illness. 3. Your pet has received diagnostics for other causes of symptoms of Upper Respiratory Infection such as a respiratory panel. According to the CDC, there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 from pets. The best place for your animal is inside the home they know and love. If you aren’t feeling well but are still able to provide care for your pet, please keep them at home with you where they’re most comfortable. With your whole family on board and a plan in place, you’ll feel better about your pet’s safety knowing they’re in good hands no matter what challenges may arise. In addition, keeping area animal shelters free of long-term care animals allows them to be better prepared for the onset of kitten season, stray pets and animal care cases that require immediate attention.

The Corona Virus & Oil Prices. 	"The recent Corona Virus epidemic in China has the world on high alert as other countries stay vigilant to stem the spread of the illness that has already claimed hundreds of lives.
Markets around the world have been doing weird things as a result of the threat as well as the extended Chinese new year holidays which has seen millions of people staying at home and not consuming products and services as usual. The Effect On Petrol & Oil Usage
Which so many Chinese people staying at home and avoiding travel as well as so many businesses not running at full efficiency there has been a massive drop in petrol and (Brent crude) oil in China . Add to this the reduction in airplane travel to and from Asia in general and China in particular and the impact is significant. This has seen the price of Brent Crude’s cost drop by a massive 20% (just after it had been peaking in January) in just a few days. ‘China is the worlds largest oil importer and worlds second biggest economy’
China is the worlds largest oil importer and worlds second biggest economy and they usually use about 14 million barrels of oil a day. Their consumption is now down by 20% so far and could look to fall further.
The response of the large oil producing countries is to reduce their production (so this means less supply ) and thus push prices up to offset the losses they are facing in China as they try to keep their profits high. It is as yet unclear what that means for the long term petrol price future in South Africa. For now, in the short term, the fuel prices are falling. 93 & 95 are both going down by 13 cents/litre (not by 20% locally mind you) and diesel is dropping by 5 cents/litre as of 5 February 2020.
The volatility of the Rand vs the Dollar is also a big factor in working out petrol prices. The Rand has also been on the international rollercoaster ride that has been caused by the appearance of the Corona virus. Also Check Out These Stories Will Petrol Prices Drop?
Petrol Price Could Drop At the end of February it is likely that the minister of Finance will announce the annual change to the amount of the fuel levy and Road Accident Fund Levy which then come into effect in April. At present the Fuel Levy sits at R2.55/l (petrol)… ABSA and China Development Bank do $100 Million Deal
ABSA And China Development Bank Finalise Huge Deal ABSA has just concluded a 5 year R1 322 980 000 deal with the China Development Bank to help develop Small and Medium Enterprises locally (and in some other African states)."
Corona Virus Part II. 	"A little over two weeks ago, I wrote to you about the corona virus (COVID-19) epidemic in a blog post titled, ‘Corona Virus: What to Do.’ In that post, I suggested that corona virus, like most flu-like viruses, can be effectively managed with a holistic approach of eating a diet free of refined sugar, taking vitamins and minerals—particularly vitamins A, C, and D as well as iodine, and avoiding the flu shot.
Why avoid the flu shot? The flu shot is approximately 1-2% effective in preventing the flu—that is the absolute risk difference which is much more reliable than relative risk difference. That means the flu shot fails to protect the vast majority who receive it. And, there are studies that found those who get the flu shot are MORE susceptible to similar non-flu-like viruses including, you guessed it, corona virus. Getting the flu shot and increasing one’s risk to other flu- and non-flu-like illnesses was first written about 60 years ago by Thomas Francis, Jr., M.D. (1) Sixty years of an expensive, lousy medical intervention is enough; the flu vaccine should be pulled from the market.
But, I digress.
The new corona virus, COVID-19 is still spreading in China and elsewhere. As of 2.14.20, the data indicates that 1,400 have died and over 64,000 are infected. Although those numbers are grim, I would like to put them in perspective . These numbers correlate to a 2% death rate (1,400/64,000). In other words, 98% of those infected survive. Keep in mind, those are the reported numbers. I am certain there are many more infected people who are staying home convalescing on their own. Factoring those individuals in the total numbers would lower the death rate.
Any death is a tragedy, but the death rate from this new corona virus strain is not severe. I think we will see a significant amount of corona virus infection in the US but I think our death rate will be lower. We do not live in as crowded nor as polluted conditions as the Chinese do in the affected cities.
As with any viral illness, the best protective measures are to ensure the body has all the nutrients it needs to maintain a strong immune system. That means eating a clean diet free of refined sugar, maintaining optimal hydration and ensuring that you have optimal levels of vitamins and minerals.
At my office, we find great success with doing IV nutrient therapy when our patients are ill with a viral or bacterial infection. I received a note from a physician colleague of mine (a “Yooper”) who, at my request, gave himself a hydrogen peroxide IV and recovered from the flu in a day. Intravenous vitamin C, glutathione and ozone are other therapies that also help with viral infections.
Holistically, there are a lot of things to do for a viral infection like corona virus. Conventionally, there is little to offer. My best suggestion? Become a patient at the Center for Holistic Medicine . We have many safe and effective therapies to treat viral, bacterial, parasitic, and yeast infections. IF you don’t live near my office, find a holistic practitioner near you.
My final predictions: The corona virus (COVID-19) will cause a large number of US citizens to become ill with an eventful viral illness. I think the death rate will be low. However, viruses can mutate. It is best to prepare yourself in advance by following the steps I outlined in this and my previous blog post, ‘Corona Virus: What To Do.”"
What about this conspiracy theory? The Chinese government stole the corona virus. 	"What about this conspiracy theory?
The Chinese government stole the corona virus from a Canadian research facility after which it escaped.
""A Canadian government scientist at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg made at least five trips to China in 2017-18, including one to train scientists and technicians at China's newly certified Level 4 lab, which does research with the most deadly pathogens. Xiangguo Qiu — who was escorted out of the Winnipeg lab in July amid an RCMP investigation into what's being described by Public Health Agency of Canada as a possible ""policy breach"" — was invited to go to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences twice a year for two years, for up to two weeks each time. ""This will be third-party funded, and therefore no cost to [the Public Health Agency of Canada],"" say the documents, obtained through access to information requests. The identity of the third-party was redacted. During a Sept. 19-30, 2017, trip, she also met with collaborators in Beijing, the documents say, but their names have also been blacked out. [People working inside the lab] who asked not to be identified for fears of retribution, say there have always been questions about Qiu's trips to China — and what information and technology she was sharing with researchers there. ""It's not right that she's a Canadian government employee providing details of top-secret work and know-how to set up a high-containment lab for a foreign nation,"" one employee said.
[Source] (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/national-microbiology-lab-scientist-investigation-china-1.5307424)
So she went to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory multiple times, which is a newly certified Level 4 lab that does research with the most deadly pathogens. She may have brought the virus with her.
The lab is located in Wuhan, close to the Yangtze ([Address](http://english.whiov.cas.cn/About_Us2016/Contact2016)). When the facility was being built there were already worries that a virus could escape. ""In 2017, as the opening of the lab approached, scientists told the publication Nature of their worries that one of those killer viruses could ‘escape’ and go on to infect members of the public. Tim Trevan, a Maryland biosafety consultant, said he had fears China’s culture could make the institute unsafe because ‘structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important’.""

In a Nature article it is stated that ""the SARS visus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times"". [Source](https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487)
The point of outbreak of the virus is said to be the Huanan Seafood Market, which is about 20 kilometers or a half hour drive away from the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory if you look it up on Google Maps. I'm not entirely convinced.

Colloidal Silver Heals Sick Cat (Corona virus FIP). 	"According to Pet Health Network, “Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a progressive and often fatal disease that’s caused by a coronavirus.”
WebMD says the coronavirus behind FIP tends to attack the cells on the intestinal wall of cats, causing painful inflammation of the belly, plus, fluid buildup in the abdomen and chest cavity resulting in difficulty breathing.
In other forms of FIP, lesions develop on the cat’s organs, which can result in neurological symptoms such as seizures or paralysis. Liver and kidney problems can also develop.
What’s more, if the coronavirus mutates to a more virulent form, it can weaken a cat’s immune system to the point the infection spreads throughout the body, often resulting in death.
So can colloidal silver help heal sick cats of FIP? The answer might surprise you…
A Startling Testimonial
A Micro-Particle Colloidal Silver Generator user wrote me to say that he’d saved his cat from FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) using one eye dropper full of colloidal silver several times a day.
Quote: :
“Using the “standard” colloidal silver concentration produced during a three-hour generation from our Micro-Particle Colloidal Silver Generator, we have successfully “cured” two different infections that conventional medicine has not consistently addressed.
“In particular, Bruiser, our Japanese Bobtail, was sentenced to certain death by a local vet who declared that the kitty’s illness indicated by lab tests was FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) and was incurable.
Three other vets confirmed the FIP and the death sentence, including an area alternative medicine vet who refused my suggestion to try colloidal silver, and “abused” the kitty with vitamin shots (to no avail).
“For the first few months after Bruiser’s veterinarians failed to successfully address the FIP, my wife and I gave him an eyedropper full (approximately 1 teaspoon) several times daily. His appetite improved quickly and he started playing with his sister again, so we reduced the dosage to several times a week.
“Bruiser is now another five years older (total six+ years) and is well and healthy. We occasionally fill an eye dropper and give him a drink if he seems to be feeling lethargic.
“We feel that colloidal silver performed miraculously, where conventional ‘cat medicine’ and veterinarians failed the test.
“Two young teens in our neighborhood find the same formula very effective in controlling their acne. The best testimony stems from their respective mothers coming back for more!”
— Dale T., CO
So you’ll never convince Bruiser’s owner that colloidal silver doesn’t work for FIP.
Controversy
Yet, oddly, people who run online FIP support groups consistently denigrate the use of colloidal silver for cats with FIP, even when people write in and say they successfully used it on their cats and cured the FIP.
Indeed, virtually every single time a colloidal silver user posts a success story about helping their cat heal from FIP, people from online FIP groups begin posting negative comments like “Take your cat to a vet” and “colloidal silver is dangerous” and “your cat probably didn’t really have FIP.”
One lady even chastised another lady who had used colloidal silver to heal her cat of FIP, by saying, “Giving cats colloidal silver for FIP takes much-needed resources away from fighting the virus.”
Of course, there’s no clinical documentation whatsoever provided for that claim. It’s just an emotional claim, with no basis in fact. And it flies in the face of the experiences of thousands of people who have successfully given their pets — cats, dogs, horses, birds, reptiles and others — colloidal silver to help fight and/or prevent infections.
So, using colloidal silver to help a cat with FIP might be a bit controversial, depending upon who you ask. But I’ve heard from more than one cat lover who said it worked for them like gangbusters, and with no side effects whatsoever.
More Testimonials
Here’s another case in which colloidal silver apparently cured a nasty case of FIP:
Hi Steve! I wanted to give you a update on ‘Ditto,’ my kitten with FIP.
He’s been on the Silver since last year. He should be a year old around May, they aren’t sure when he was born. He was pulled from his mom at a young age."
World leaders launch plan to speed COVID-19 drugs, vaccine; U.S. stays away . 	"World leaders pledged on Friday to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a video conference to launch what the WHO billed as a ""landmark collaboration"" to fight the pandemic.
The aim is to speed development of safe and effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the lung disease caused be the novel coronavirus - and ensure equal access to treatments for rich and poor.
""We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he opened the virtual meeting.
""Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.""
During the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.
""We must make sure that people who need them get them,"" said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. ""The lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.
""This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,"" von der Leyen told the conference.
""COMMON FIGHT""
Leaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.
A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.
""Although the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,"" he said by email.
""We remain deeply concerned about the WHO's effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,"" he later said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being ""China-centric"" and announced a suspension of funding.
Tedros has steadfastly defended the WHO's handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.
Macron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.
Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: ""And I hope we'll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying 'the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle'.""
Merkel said: ""This concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.""
Ramaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was ""extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support"".
VACCINE TRIALS
More than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.
""As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,"" said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO's second largest donor last year.
More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.
""We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritise vaccine candidates,"" he told a Geneva news briefing.
Yuan Qiong, senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Access Campaign welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps. ""There shouldn't be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this pandemic,"" she told Reuters."
Corona virus in the cyberspace?!. 	The Corona Virus had been sweeping some countries in the world recently; mongering fear in the news and adding disruption to what has been a disastrous month of January 2020. The virus, however, doesn't only make its presence in the cities, as Kaspersky has recently found malicious disguised as documents related to the newly discovered viral disease. They were masked under the guise of pdf, mp4, and docx files about the coronavirus; with their names implying that they contain video instructions on how to protect yourself from the virus, updates on the threat and even virus detection procedures. But instead, these files contained a range of threats from Trojans to worms which are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of computers or computer networks. “The coronavirus, which is being widely discussed as a major news story, has already been used as bait by cybercriminals. So far we have seen only 10 unique files, but as this sort of activity often happens with popular media topics then we expect that this tendency may grow. As people continue to be worried about their health, we may see more and more malware hidden inside fake documents about the coronavirus being spread,” comments Anton Ivanov, Kaspersky malware analyst. Kaspersky products detect “coronavirus” related malicious files with the following detection names
Agastiya Biotech Proceeding with Drug Candidate for COVID-19. 	"Agastiya Biotech LLC ( www.agastiyabiotech.com ) today announces it has discovered its previously tested anti-cancer small molecule AB001 as a viable SARS-CoV-2 virus therapeutic. Based on in silico models, AB001 acts on ACE-2 to inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell and also works on NSP15 to prevent its replication. Interestingly the molecule also has demonstrated zero toxicity in earlier in vitro and in vivo studies.
Recent results identify AB001 as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Dr. MG Dinesh, senior scientist for Agastiya Biotech says, “Our work carries promise that AB001 may halt SARS-CoV-2 progression to severe disease state and prophylactically protect frontline health care workers in areas with existing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.”
Currently multiple antivirals are under evaluation in randomized control trials to treat COVID-19 including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir. AB001 is highly bioavailable, has multiple targets and also is immunomodulatory besides being an anti-viral agent.
Agastiya Biotech’s lead development candidate acts in the following ways: Stopping Supernatant and Cell Associated Viral RNA Replication Stopping SARS-CoV-2 Entry and Replication Targeting Cytokine Storms in the Lungs Increasing the number and activity of cytotoxic T cells Promoting activation of macrophages, NK (natural killer) cells and DC (dendritic cells) which facilitate Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) to CD4+ and CD8+ in the immune response
Agastiya Biotech intends to begin human clinical trials of AB001 this year. Agastiya Biotech’s founder, Dr. Baskaran Pillai, says, “The lead development candidate, AB001, has potential to be preventive as well as therapeutic in early stages to metastatic levels of cancer. Our game changing discoveries in carcinoma therapies are twofold: elimination of cancer stem cells and no or minimum toxicity to normal cells.”
About Agastiya Biotech
Agastiya Biotech ( www.agastiyabiotech.com ), is a biotechnology and new drug development company based in San Diego, CA. Agastiya Biotech’s innovative methodologies have created several novel small molecules with patents for different types of cancer including the most challenging leukemia and pancreatic cancer. Founder Dr. Baskaran Pillai’s vision for Agastiya Biotech is to create new medicine for the 21 st century through an eclectic approach of Western biotech and ancient Indian therapeutics."

Antibody detection may disable Corona virus 2019-nCoV. 	"Chinese molecular biologists revealed one of the antibodies discovered during the pneumonia epidemic in 2003 that could neutralize the Corona 2019-nCoV virus, also known as Wuhan virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the incubation period for corona virus ranged from 2 to 10 days before the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and acute respiratory failure. Photo: TASS
TASS news agency quoted the scientists’ post on the bioRxiv e-library site as saying: “We first announced that the CR3022 could strongly link with 2019-nCoV RBD. It is interesting that some of the strongest antibodies (eg m396, CR3014) cannot combine with the mutant protein of 2019-nCoV. ”
The findings, according to scientists at Wuhan Institute of Virology and Fudan University in Shanghai, have given hope that the CR3022 compound combined with other antibodies may bind to the new strain of Corona virus. allow the creation of effective remedies for acute pneumonia, and stop the spread of disease.
The team reached this conclusion after looking at how the copy of RBD protein - which the 2019-nCoV virus uses to penetrate into human cells - interacts with countless antibodies found in muscles. patient or was created during the pneumonia epidemic in 2003.
These virus strains are closely related and have similar RBD proteins. Therefore, Chinese experts assess that there is a small chance that these old molecules will also neutralize new pathogens. CR3022 met the hope on the other four antibodies, including the m336 synthetic cure - created a few years ago at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - that didn’t respond to the 2019-nCoV protein.
This finding surprised the experts because the computer model did not show that the small difference of the RBD protein would make 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. Scientists are continuing to study blood samples from infected people in hopes of finding other antibodies that are more likely to bind to the 2019-nCoV virus than CR3022.
The new corona virus has spread to many cities in China and many countries around the world, including tha‌iland, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, USA, Nepal, France, Australia, Vietnam, Canada and Malaysia. On the morning of January 30, Chinese officials announced that there are 7,711 cases of corona virus in 31 provinces and cities in the country and a total of 170 people have died."
covid-19 lockdown: Consumer MNCs point to lockdown blues in India. 	"Chief executives of leading global consumer goods companies such as Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Kimberly-Clark said India ’s Covid-19 lockdown protocols had led to severe supply chain disruptions and labour shortages, hurting business in a key market.
“When countries go through that initial government overreaction, we go and tell them, you don’t want to (cut) back on supplies of hygiene products—and then they are relaxed,” Unilever CEO Alan Jope told investors on an earnings call Thursday. “In northern Italy, there was a shutdown and within four hours, we got a relaxation order for the essential goods that we make. In India, it is taking us about four or five days to get that relaxation.”
Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the local unit of the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, has seen production halts and transport holdups as have by most of its peers. India’s biggest consumer goods maker HUL is regarded as a proxy for consumer sentiment across the socio-economic spectrum.
Smaller Suppliers Hit Too
A three-week lockdown imposed across the country on March 25 was extended to May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19.
“India is a big deal for us right now, which as a country (went) to a complete standstill in the last week of March. We are back selling and manufacturing in India, not at full strength, but at some good strength in a context where many are still unable to operate the business,” Jope said, echoing the sentiment of other consumer-facing firms in India that are struggling with the sporadic supply of raw materials and uncertainty over last-mile delivery.
Out of 157 units owned by listed fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, 68 facilities, or 43%, are in Covid-19 red zone districts, which means no activities barring essential services are allowed as they seek to curb the outbreak. This, in turn, has hurt smaller suppliers of products such as packaging materials and chemicals.
“In some markets like India, the severity of social distancing measures has negatively impacted consumption simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips,” beverage maker Coca-Cola’s chief executive James Quincey said in a post-earnings call on Tuesday.
The maker of Coca-Cola, Thums Up and Minute Maid juices said unit case volume across its bottling investment ecosystem fell 5%, which it attributed to the lockdown in India. ET reported April 23 that Coca-Cola India, the country’s largest beverage maker, will write off the value of surplus inventory at bottling partners, with large quantities of soft drinks and juices left unsold during the lockdown as the company braces for its worst quarter ever.
“The more recent emphasis with Covid-19 now is making sure that we can maintain operational supply in India, and that's been a big focus. We were down for a period of time, while we were getting the right permits to operate as an essential business,” said Michael Hsu, chairman of Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues, on an analyst call on Wednesday.
While the situation has eased significantly after factories were closed in several places by law-enforcement authorities initially, many employees, especially at these units, refused to come to work for fear of catching the disease or have gone back home to their villages.
“Once we establish our ability to operate, we then have to source materials and we have to ensure that employees can get to work, which sounds simple, but is anything but,” Procter & Gamble vice chairman Jon Moeller told investors last week, referring to the Indian market."
A Day Old Baby Becomes Youngest Carrier of Corona Virus. 	"A 30 hours old baby has become the youngest coronavirus case since the outbreak of the flu-like virus which has killed over 565 people.
The medical test which confirmed that the baby who was born on February 2 in Wuhan is infected with the virus,
has led to speculation that the lethal illness could potentially be passed from a mother to a fetus as the baby’s mother tested positive to the virus before giving birth.
The baby weighed 3.25kg at birth (7lbs 2oz) and is now in a stable condition and under observation.
Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
who also developed a vaccine for Sars (another coronavirus which spread in China in 2003), said there is more to know about the virus.
He said;
“We’re still in the deep learning curve about this virus. There’s more we don’t know than we do know about the new coronavirus.
“We know it happens for instance in HIV-Aids, but even there in the pre-retroviral drug era when I was taking care of infants with Aids, even in untreated mothers it was still only about 25% [of cases]”.
Chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital’s neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters;
“This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission.”  "

Before COVID-19 shaped our new reality, 55% of eggs nationally went to retail, according to the Columbia Missourian. Now, 80% of all eggs are going to the grocery store.
According to Jo Manhart, director of The Missouri Egg Council, that reflects the change in how egg producers are operating until restaurants and schools reopen.
Columbia Public Schools closed March 18, causing food producers like Dustin Stanton to lose business.
“They all literally have gone to zero. We lost a lot of sales on half of our business,” Stanton said. He’s co-owner of Stanton Brothers Eggs in Centralia with his brother, Austin.
But because of the increase in retail demand, sales are now higher than ever. Demand has increased so much, Stanton’s now having to choose which of his clients get to fill their shelves with his eggs.
Other egg producers across Missouri have experienced the same uptick. Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms has two egg-laying operations in Missouri, one in Knob Noster and the other in Hawk Point. They have seen “an unprecedented surge in egg demand,” Communications Coordinator Clay Brown said.
Smaller producers also are benefiting from the demand for eggs.
Ben Roberts, who operates Ben Roberts’ Heritage Poultry & Eggs in Fortuna, said he’s also seen an increase in demand. He’s been selling eggs for 65 years.
“It has been the best thing to ever happen to me,” Roberts said.
Jim Hayes owns Hayes Happy Hens in Tunas. Hayes and his wife began cultivating pasture-raised hens in 2016. With 10,500 birds, they’re collecting about 10,000 eggs a day, but they’re not selling directly to retail.
They sell to Vital Farms, an egg processor based in Springfield. Vital Farms takes Hayes’ eggs and sells them to grocery stores around the state.
According to Vital Farms, demand from retailers has increased up to 150% compared to last March.
Hayes says he’s continuing to operate as normal. Because he only gets a finite amount of eggs per day, there’s no way to increase supply.
Most grocery stores were not prepared for what March brought. Panic buying and stockpiling by consumers left many shelves bare. Inventory is improving now, but stores big and small are still competing with each other to restock products such as eggs.
Patty Clover owns Clover’s Natural Market, with two Columbia locations — off East Broadway and at Chapel Plaza Court. She gets her eggs from the Stantons and has been buying from the brothers since 2012.
“We immediately got hit as soon as people started getting scared,” Clover said. “The panic hit, I think every store in Columbia and the throngs of people that were just clearing off our shelves.”
Clover worries that her local supplies might be swayed by the bigger stores offering bigger orders — and a higher price.
“They can’t supply everybody, so we’re just praying that they remember us and don’t just cut us out to go for the big guys,” she said.
Stanton insists that he’s doing his best to make sure that doesn’t happen. He and his brother have maintained their commitment to supplying to locals first.
“We’ve had all sorts of calls from states hours away, and we really just turned all of them down. We really just turned them down to supply our local stores the best that we can,” Stanton said.
Most producers are doing the same. Rose Acres’ is only guaranteeing each retailer the number of eggs it’s historically purchased. Vital Farms is increasing production where it can to meet the higher demand.
Because of fears that eggs will never get back on the shelves, a number of people are taking an alternative route to ensure they’ll have eggs in the coming months.
Jeff Smith’s family has been selling egg-laying chickens at Cackle Hatchery in Lebanon for over 40 years. They’ve seen a spike in the number of birds being purchased in the recent weeks.
“Right now, certain breeds, we’re booking out two and three months out into the future,” Smith said.
Even Stanton has had requests to buy his hens, but he said he’s turned down everyone.
There might not be green pastures ahead for some.
Stanton is relieved his business has been insulated from the challenges producers from other commodities are facing.
“I think if there’s any industry to be in right now, I’m in the right one. So, I’m actually at a lot of peace,” he said.
Even for producers like Stanton and others who have seen increased demand, there is still uncertainty.
When social distancing ends, it’s unclear exactly how many restaurants will be left to open up again. Stanton depends on them. Once demand in grocery stores returns to normal, he may not have as many restaurants to pick up the slack.
But for the time being, producers are doing their best to give back and support communities where they can.
Vital Farms donated 650,000 eggs to Ozarks Food Harvest in Springfield, and other food producers around mid-Missouri are donating extra food to support essential workers.
“I’m very optimistic about the future of it all, and I think that’s important right now,” Stanton said. “I’m really optimistic about agriculture, the industry, the food we’re eating.”
Clover, who depends on people like Stanton to keep providing food to the community, remains grateful.
“I think we’re all helping each other. So, to me, that’s the huge takeaway that, yeah, this is scary. And yeah, there’s some panic, but we’re basically going to be stronger and better from all this,” Clover said.
Right now, the stay-at-home order will continue until at least May 3. Stanton said the sooner schools and restaurants open, the faster his farm’s future will look sunny side up. "
Bayhealth Using Plasma Therapy on COVID-19 Patients, Seeks Plasm. 	"Bayhealth is using plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to treat those who are severely ill with the virus.
This type of treatment, which originated more than a century ago, is known as convalescent plasma therapy. It involves transferring antibodies from one individual to a blood-matched recipient in order to fight an infection. The Food and Drug Administration recently fast-tracked approval of its use as an investigational treatment on those who are very sick from COVID-19.
Bayhealth administered plasma to its first COVID-19 patient recently and is currently seeking donors for a convalescent plasma bank program offered in partnership through the Blood Bank of Delmarva.
Bayhealth Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine physician Dr. Pedro Dammert, MD, said that recently published clinical studies show good clinical outcomes with plasma therapy and they’re eager to use this promising treatment on more individuals with COVID-19 infections. “Each donation can provide up to four units of plasma that could help two or three sick patients,” said Dr. Dammert, MD. “Plasma donation is a safe and cost-free way for those who’ve recovered from COVID-19 to give back and potentially save lives.”
One Bayhealth employee, Lindsey Locke, wgi recently became a plasma donor, shared how rewarding the experience was.
“I was really excited for my plasma donation appointment. I definitely like to help people—that’s why I became a certified nursing assistant,” said Locke. “Working in the hospital, it was heartbreaking to see patients so sick from COVID-19. I actually felt a sense of guilt that I didn’t get very sick from it, so I knew I wanted to donate my plasma to help those that were suffering more. I hope as many others that are able to can give back by doing the same.”
Candidates for the convalescent plasma bank program are individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and have recovered and been symptom-free for at least 14 days, and who meet other typical blood bank requirements. Donors can give plasma multiple times at appropriate time intervals. All plasma donations will go to a general pool to be used for patients at Bayhealth as well as other healthcare facilities who obtain blood products from the Blood Bank of Delmarva. This program is sponsored through a nationwide research initiative at the Mayo Clinic and federally financed so there is no cost to the donor, the recipient or to Bayhealth.
For more details on this program or if you’re interested in being a plasma donor, please contact Coronavirus Management Team member Holly Dapias, RN, at 302-612-1862. Registration is also available at www.delmarvablood.org ."

Chinese Medical Team is Required to Take Traditional Medicines When They Want to Work Against Corona Virus. 	"The director of a hospital in Henan province, explained how to protect doctors from the new type of coronavirus or COVID-19, by taking traditional Chinese medicine.
Administrative staff who are not directly related to patients are encouraged to drink dry ginger soup mixed with licorice or liquorice. Whereas doctors who work in clinics must take Guizhi Tang or cinnamon-based formulas. In addition, they are also required to drink the fungus Fuling and Bai Zhu, a type of herb that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. These herbs are believed to protect the body's immunity to strengthen the function of the spleen.

She sold her soul to the devil': Dr Birx's reaction after Trump suggests injecting disinfectant to cure COVID-19 goes viral. 	"Citing a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report, US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) said that coronavirus has a less chance of surviving in a warm and humid environment as opposed to cold and dry weather where it stays put. The study also showed that bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly.
Speaking in a press brief at the White House, Trump said, ""The scientists at Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have released a report offering how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces.""
""The findings confirm the virus survives better in colder, drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments,"" he added.
The US President said that he made the proposal of hot weather&apos;s impact on the virus earlier, which was not received well, and now ""it seems like that might be the case.""
""So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous - whether it&apos;s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,"" the president said, turning to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, ""and I think you said that hasn&apos;t been checked but you&apos;re going to test it.
""And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you&apos;re going to test that too. Sounds interesting,"" the president continued.
""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute,"" Trump said. ""One minute! And is there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it&apos;d be interesting to check that. So, that you&apos;re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.""
Netizens didn&apos;t take long to unleash a meme riot on Dr Deborah&apos;s reaction to Trump&apos;s bizarre suggestion.
Sorry, but she already sold her soul to the devil."

Fulton elections employee dies of COVID-19 before Georgia primary. 	"A Fulton County elections employee has died from COVID-19 and a voter registration manager was hospitalized, slowing the county’s ability to handle a flood of absentee ballot requests for Georgia’s June 9 primary.
Beverly Walker, a registration officer, died April 15 at age 62, said Fulton Elections Director Richard Barron.
Registration Chief Ralph Jones also suffered coughing and shortness of breath, symptoms associated with COVID-19. Jones was treated at a hospital for low oxygen levels and was released after less than a day.
The Fulton elections office closed for two days last week for deep cleaning and decontamination, Barron said.
About 113,000 Fulton voters have submitted absentee ballot request forms so they can vote by mail, Barron said, but just 10,738 of them had been processed through Wednesday.
“With this mortality rate, this is really nothing to play around with,” Barron said. “What are we going to do if a voter is in line that’s exhibiting symptoms? Are we allowed to use non-contact thermometers to take people’s temperature? Are we allowed to send someone home if they’re in line with a fever?”
Barron said further guidance is needed to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is encouraging voters to cast ballots remotely and avoid human contact at precincts. His office mailed absentee ballot request forms to the state’s 6.9 million active voters, and more than 701,000 of them have already been returned and processed through Wednesday, according to state data.
But in-person voting locations must remain open on election day and during three weeks of early voting beginning May 18, according to state law. Polling places will be equipped with cleaning supplies and protective gear for poll workers.
Barron wants to avoid the kind of situation seen in Wisconsin’s April 7 primary, when crowds of voters waited in long lines and many precincts were closed.
As of Tuesday, 19 people in Wisconsin who tested positive for COVID-19 reported they had voted in person or worked at the polls, but it’s unclear whether they contracted the illness at precincts or somewhere else.
To catch up on the backlog of absentee ballot requests, 30 employees are on loan to the elections office from county’s tax commissioner and tax assessor. They’ve spread out across the atrium of the Fulton government center in downtown Atlanta.
Walker and Jones last worked in the office March 23. Jones wasn't tested for the coronavirus early this month when tests were in short supply, but his doctors told him it was likely he contracted the illness. Jones is now working from home.
Walker worked in the elections office since 1997 and was a registration supervisor when she retired in 2012. She continued to work part-time since then.
Beverly A. Walker, a Fulton County elections employee, died from illness related to COVID19 on April 15, 2020. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Walker knew everything about running elections, including registration, absentee voting and petitions, Jones said. She was a mild-mannered and giving person who liked to cook for the elections staff.
It’s unknown whether Walker and Jones caught the coronavirus from each other or separately.
“We’re trying to adhere to the policies of making sure that everybody is six feet away, and we’re trying not to overtax the workers,” Jones said. “We are actually functioning. The numbers should be really coming on board soon.”
The county expects to catch up on processing absentee ballot requests by Wednesday, Barron said. Ballots will be mailed to voters a day or two after they’re processed."
Novel Corona Virus: Nature Strikes Back. 	"No, I don’t agree at all. The bat droppings with this novel corona virus could have come from anywhere and could have contaminated anything. That said, it does not help but rather raises the odds for such a contamination to have contact where hygiene is so poor. But that’s true throughout the world where humans and animals and birds share space. This is where various avian flu arise. This is where various swine flu arise. This is where various rodent plagues arise. Proximity without stringent hygiene produces viral mutations and then easy cross-contamination. So it’s a public health through proper and responsible hygiene issue and not a meat issue.
This is why strict regulation is usually a priority for foods likely to come into contact with feces… because under good hygiene practices, various kinds of outbreaks still occur. The real discussion about a response policy, then, should be about control and containment and hygiene and one of the ways this has to be done is to change the practices of these kinds of magnet locations like open air markets. We used to have the same problem with central water sources and plagues so it’s not like we have to reinvent how to address it. Vilifying meat or those who eat it is just a distraction. Bats will be bats and will be attracted to anything that is easily edible or that increases populations of edible insects. And that means they will pop almost every time they take off to fly."
2 suspected corona cases in Sudan: Minister. 	"Sudan’s health minister Akram Ali Altoum said Wednesday two suspected cases of coronavirus has entered his country through Egypt and Ethiopia.
Authorities are taking precautionary measures to protect the country from the disease, he told reporters after a meeting of the Sudanese Council of Ministers.
He said one of the cases is currently in Gazeera state and the other in the capital Khartoum.
“We received two suspected cases came from China through Cairo and Addis Ababa ... we want to stress here that the two cases haven’t been confirmed yet but we take the samples and then send them abroad with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO) to test it” he said.
“We are on high precautions with the different concerning authorities including the sea, land and airports as well as the ministries of interior, migration and others. We are also in full coordination with the WHO to help us be in compliance with the international standards in this regard” he explained.
Thousands of Chinese work in different sectors in Sudan, especially oil workers.
The virus first appeared in China but has spread to 19 countries with more than 6,000 cases and 132 deaths.
Symptoms include runny nose, fever, headache, cough and a sore throat."

Catalonia, Brexit and a virus called Corona. 	"Winds of change are a-blowing and dark clouds are a-rising in the horizon with worldwide news regarding Brexit and the scary virus named corona hitting the headlines heavily during the past week. But how do these global issues actually affect Spain and Catalonia in general and Barcelona in particular?
Brexit finally went through last Friday night after 3 years of back and forth, and has of course been closely followed even here in Catalonia for obvious reasons, as a possible Catalan independence would naturally spiral the new country out of the European Union – which of course might be considered by some as just a drop in the ocean in the big picture. Then again the bittersweet divorce between Great Britain and Europe has shown that despite a big part of the population being partial to a quick reunion the majority still counts and the results are always more or less uncertain. So with talks between the Catalan and Spanish government coming up as well as new election due in Catalonia soon, this is a very interesting issue.
The other headline of the week, the fast spreading deadly corona-virus originating from China, has been the other topic of the street even here in Spain, where no actual cases of infections have yet been reported. At the moment it seems like some alarmed parts of the population have so far mostly managed to block many emergency rooms, and the authorities are trying to calm things down and keep the panic away. Spain has also evacuated all its citizens willing to leave the epicenter and they are now being kept in a 2 week quarantine in a hospital, while media is covering the events closely.
Barcelona has her own decisions to make regarding this fast-spreading virus with the Mobile World Congress coming up soon. This potential risk of a happening is at least at the moment unaltered – let’s see what the next weeks will bring regarding possible restrictions for these kinds of international events. As usual we’ll keep you updated on all of this as well as some of the other stuff going on here in this blog and on our Instagram and Facebook accounts as well! So let’s keep our hands and hearts warm and our heads cool!
Venue of the week: Honest Greens café in Barcelona Chocolate cake with salty caramel made of cauliflower at Barcelona’s Honest Greens café This week we took an encore of the lovely Honest Greens restaurant we described in an earlier post , but with a little twist having a sweet bite for dessert in their café by the entrance. This is actually quite a common concept with many chains in Barcelona: having the main restaurant in the inner parts of the building and a little coffee shop with tasty bites luring you in from the street or prolonging the stay at the entrance. We tasted some of the healthy sweet bites as well as some tasty coffee and tea, and were positively surprised by the yummy taste of the snacks on offer. Don’t miss it if you are in the hoods and have a sweet tooth but want to keep it healthy!

CDC: Risk in U.S. from 2019-nCoV remains low. 	"A total of 165 persons in the United States are under investigation for infection with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), with 68 testing negative and only 5 confirming positive, according to data presented Jan. 29 during a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) briefing.
The remaining samples are in transit or are being processed at the CDC for testing, Nancy Messonnier, MD , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the briefing.
“The genetic sequence for all five viruses detected in the United States to date has been uploaded to the CDC website,” she said. “We are working quickly through the process to get the CDC-developed test into the hands of public health partners in the U.S. and internationally.”
Dr. Messonnier reported that the CDC is expanding screening efforts to U.S. ports of entry that house CDC quarantine stations. Also, in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency is expanding distribution of travel health education materials to all travelers from China.
“The good news here is that, despite an aggressive public health investigation to find new cases [of 2019-nCoV], we have not,” she said. “The situation in China is concerning, however, we are looking hard here in the U.S. We will continue to be proactive. I still expect that we will find additional cases.”
In another development, the federal government facilitated the return of a plane full of U.S. citizens living in Wuhan, China, to March Air Reserve Force Base in Riverside County, Calif. “We have taken every precaution to ensure their safety while also continuing to protect the health of our nation and the people around them,” Dr. Messonnier said.
All 195 passengers have been screened, monitored, and evaluated by medical personnel “every step of the way,” including before takeoff, during the flight, during a refueling stop in Alaska, and again upon landing at March Air Reserve Force Base on Jan. 28. “All 195 patients are without the symptoms of the novel coronavirus, and all have been assigned living quarters at the Air Force base,” Dr. Messonnier said.
The CDC has launched a second stage of further screening and information gathering from the passengers, who will be offered testing as part of a thorough risk assessment.
“I understand that many people in the U.S. are worried about this virus and whether it will affect them,” Dr. Messonnier said. “Outbreaks like this are always concerning, particularly when a new virus is emerging. But we are well prepared and working closely with federal, state, and local partners to protect our communities and others nationwide from this public health threat. At this time, we continue to believe that the immediate health risk from this new virus to the general American public is low.” "
Toyota's Community Service Announcement Targets Hardest Hit Communities In Fight Against COVID-19. 	"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the lives of millions of Americans from rural towns to cities, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) has created a Community Service Announcement (CSA) to bring awareness and credible information to the African American and Hispanic communities around the country which are among the hardest hit by the virus.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NYSE:TM. Click here to check it out. NYSE:TM NYSE:TM NYSE:TM Titled #UsAgainstCOVID , the CSA, featuring a number of high-profile African American and Hispanic celebrities including Anthony Anderson , Cedric The Entertainer and Lupita Infante, aims to help these affected communities understand the risks, share steps on how to avoid contracting the virus and direct them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) web site for more information.
""With the aim of giving back to the American communities in which we operate, we partnered with high-profile celebrities to bring an important prevention message to communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by this deadly virus,"" said Chris Reynolds , chief administrative officer, Manufacturing and Corporate Resources for TMNA. ""We moved quickly to make this CSA and are hopeful it will make a meaningful impact in the communities hardest hit by the COVID pandemic. We're all in this together and we must work together to regain the health of our country, no matter where we live.""
The CSA debuted on BET's social channels during their Saving Our Selves (S.O.S.) : A BET COVID-19 Relief Fund Effort broadcast last evening and will continue to run on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other digital channels through May 6. This CSA includes videos in 60-second and 30-second formats in both English and Spanish.
According to CDC data, African Americans were hospitalized at higher rates than whites for COVID-19. Several states also released their own data showing that African Americans are dying at disproportional rates from COVID-19. And in some major cities, more Hispanics per capita are succumbing to the illness than any other ethnic group.

The color you see depends on the metal or blend of metals in the firework.We are all familiar with combustion releasing visible light and X rays. This is because they do molecular nuclear fusion. 3CmHn+pO2+SP+P->(mCO2-E)+r(He+O+L...Xray)the flame nearest be pressurised and we need a spark! Then we are doing nuclear fusion.So all burning carbohydrates or hydrocarbons, does nuclear fusion! Using 3. There is A simpler method, that does not involve the production of carbon dioxide.We fire up a steam plasma tube. A 50x1cm steam plasma releases 2.4 MW of heat, at 4 atmospheres. Borrow the electronics from a fluorescent light, to start the plasma off. That were then self sustain.Utilising only 10-15cc of regular water a year. A commercially source steam turbine will produce 1.2 MW of mains electricity. Carbon free power. No fossil fuel burn and certainly no hyper toxic uranium nuclear fission.Present nuclear power plants use enriched uranium to freeze heat and power. So needed annual insurance cover of 100 billion a year. After the Fukushima incident. 40 billion a year after Chernobyl in 1986.They carry a criminally insufficient 50 million. So every operating nuclear power plant on earth is running criminally under insured.The Americans found that High cause cancer and viral cells to boil and pop. Today the beauty people use an 8 W one MHZ ultrasound device, as their medically licensed HIUS source.Which will repair local tissue damage and scaring. ½ minute of this HIUS to each side the chest will clear all human infections and lung/spft body cancers, like leukaemia or. That affect the chest and blood system. As all infective viruses and bacteria do.2012 a personal contact in New York use this idea to totally clear his HIV AIDs. the worst viral infection in history cleared in 1 minute, using a licensed beauty device.And a every registered Dr. on earth had to buy such a device 2002 and confirmed the cancer cure. It works for all 200 types of cancer out there. Adjust for animals size, and he will cure all animal and pet cancers. When the animal protests, the cancer is cleared.It is also a one session total cure to all viral and bacterial infections. And every Dr. in Wuman has personally confirmed the cancer and viral cures. So antibiotic prescription became defective and criminal medicine 18 years ago. All over the world, not just in China.HIUS personally confirmed by every registered Dr. on earth. Or they were required to strike themselves off the medical register 18 years ago. They had to do so on their first prescription of antibiotics! Or of cancer drugs. It is certain your GP has not be a registered legal Dr. for 18 years. All medical practice criminal. Each resulting death warrants a legal fine of 10 million UK pounds, and all the doctors, nurses and pharmacists share jail time.So you pop into the doctors' on the way to work and they the cure your infections in 1 minute. You are then no longer infective! You can pass the infection on. You are cured. You need no drug prescription, or trip to the pharmacist.So all the 16,000 Corona infected patients in Wuhan can bob into the work nurse, or the nursing office in a social centre, and have their infection cured.The Hippocratic oath means that no registered Dr. has been a thickly allowed to research cancer and disease cures, for 18 years. Or be struck off the same day and subsequent medical practice all criminal medical malpractice.So every Corona infected patients around the world can be totally cured by 1 minute of HIUS. No need for quarantine and certainly no need for any medical drug research. Such research is criminal!Estimates of the deaths from Corona very from 800 to 1000 individuals. Each one warrants a fine of 90 million Renimbe, the Chinese currency. And all their medical staff are struck off for life. To face criminal charges for first degree medical murder.All the developed world medics who have jumped on the feeding trough that is Corona are exploiting their patients. Each and every one has personally validated HIUS clears all viral infections.I hear that the nurses on the quarantine ships are charging hospital rates, for their enforced visitors. Non of whom actually tested positive for Corona. So are due to be reimbursed for the cost of their enforced incarceration.The cure to all viruses was medically published 2002. Yet every other year, medics announce a new a viral epidemic. That just fizzles out. Remember SARs? Apparently we have not learnt anything and allow medicine to exploit us.Medicine is desperately trying to find a new source of income as all cancers where cured 18 years ago. As were all viral outbreaks! Posted by"
It's irresponsible and it's dangerous': Experts rip Trump's idea of injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19. 	"President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that disinfectants could be explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infections - an extremely dangerous proposition that could kill people, medical experts have stressed.
After a Homeland Security official mentioned the ability of disinfectants like bleach to kill the coronavirus on surfaces, Trump remarked on the effectiveness.
""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"" Trump said during his daily press briefing at the White House. ""Because you see it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So that you're going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds - it sounds interesting to me.""
Disinfectants like bleach are poisonous and dangerous when mishandled, doctors say.
""This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible and it's dangerous,"" said Dr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist, global health policy expert and an NBC News and MSNBC contributor. ""It's a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves.""
Trump's own Food and Drug Administration specifically warned against people drinking the chemicals in disinfectants ­- a fake science that has been peddled as a cure to autism and HIV for decades -noting that consumption of such ""products can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration.""
""Any amount of bleach or isopropyl alcohol or any kind of common household cleaner is inappropriate for ingestion even in small amounts. Small amounts are deadly,"" Gupta said.
Online, doctors reacted with horror.
Gupta added that it was ""demoralizing"" as a doctor to hear the White House ""peddle improper health messaging,"" and said the president had a pattern of pushing unproven medical treatments.
The president spent weeks advocating for the use of antimalarial drug hydroxycloroquine, after anecdotal evidence emerged suggesting it might help patients fighting COVID-19. On Tuesday, a study of coronavirus patients in a Veterans Affairs hospital saw more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than those treated with standard care.
""It's exceptionally dangerous,"" Gupta told NBC News. ""There's people who hang on to every word of the president.""
The claim came after a long exchange in which Trump also suggested that light and heat - which also can destroy the coronavirus on a surface - be used as a cure to the disease the virus causes in humans.
""Maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor, I'm like a person who has a good you know what,"" Trump said pointing to his head.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said she had not seen heat and light used as ""a treatment."""
Two more Nepalis detected with deadly corona virus. 	"Two more corona-virus infection cases have been reported in Kathmandu.According to the Teku-based Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital , a male and another female, who returned to Nepal from China are undergoing treatment in the isolation ward in the hospital.
Meanwhile, the government has directed all concerned departments to take precautionary measures to contain the spread of deadly disease."
A cure has been found for Corona virus - China. 	"The Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr Zhou Pingjian, says a cure has been found for coronavirus.
While addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, Pingjian said Chinese scientists were working to develop a vaccine for the virus, assuring that the epidemic would lose its momentum in the next two weeks. .
According to him; “All things considered, the epidemic can be contained, controlled and treated. The Chinese nation has gone through great winds and waves and overcome countless difficulties. .
The 1000 bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan, which was built in 9 days and is in full operation today, speaks volumes.” "
Baxter : Oxiris Blood Purification Filter Gets FDA Emergency Approval for Covid-19 Treatment. 	"Baxter International Inc. on Thursday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for the company's Oxiris filter set to treat certain Covid-19 patients.
The company said the emergency use authorization is for ""patients who have confirmed Covid-19 and have been admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure in need of blood-purification therapy to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.""
Baxter said ""a small initial shipment of Oxiris will be available in the U.S. immediately, with more significant production ramping up throughout the coming weeks and months.""
Baxter also said it is maximizing production of its CRRT dialysis machines, fluids and sets ""to help address unprecedented surges in demand for its acute dialysis products in Europe and the U.S.""
Baxter added that it has added multiple work shifts and is running facilities used to make products for Covid-19 patient care on a 24-7 basis.
Baxter has also ""partnered with its logistics providers to fly critically needed medical devices and medicines back and forth between the U.S. and Europe,"" the company said.

Coronavirus: Ontario YouTube creator shows how to whip up fun recipes amid COVID-19 isolation. 	"As people stay home amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, one Ontario YouTube creator is showing people how to whip up recipes with ingredients that can be found in the kitchen cupboard.
Glen Powell, creator from the YouTube channel Glen & Friends Cooking , has been demonstrating how to make recipes with ingredients that have been pulled from his pantry, including a no-knead bread loaf and pasta sauce that’s been made out of freezer-burnt flank steak.

“Since the quarantine started, we’ve started doing something called Stuff in our Cupboard ,” Powell told Global News.
“Because I’m under lockdown like everybody else, it has been me just pulling stuff out of my cupboard and saying, ‘OK, I got these 10 items. Let’s makes something out of it that works.'”
Across the globe, people are watching YouTube videos related to recipes and cooking at a rate of more than 45 per cent higher this year than the same period last year, according to statistics provided by YouTube Canada.
 “As Canadians are adjusting to a new way of life — that includes long days at home and just changing their routines — I think a lot are turning to YouTube for things like recipe ideas,” said Maria Cortellucci, YouTube Canada communications representative.
 “It’s really evident that there’s an interest in cooking in particular for Canadians and also those across the globe.”
4:57 How healthy are you being in self-isolation? How healthy are you being in self-isolation? While the no-knead bread and freezer-burnt steak pasta sauce have been among the top recipes on Powell’s channel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the YouTube creator said other top quarantine recipes have been for cookies, ginger beer, chicken dishes and brownies.

“Some of the recipes are quite complex, but my approach really is, you can do this,” Powell said.
Amid COVID-19 isolation, Cortellucci said YouTube has seen increases around a lot of “how-to” cooking content.
“How to make scrambled eggs has seen a couple spikes over the last while,” Cortellucci said. “Sourdough, we know, is a massive trend, and we’ve seen increases there as well.”
For the last year-and-a-half, Glen & Friends Cooking has done a Sunday morning show about Depression-era cooking, where Powell pulls a recipe from earlier in history.
 “We sort of look at the history of what the dish is and why people were eating that way at that time period,” Powell said.
“I think people are looking at the Great Depression as sort of analogous to what’s happening now with people being out of work.”
Overall, Cortellucci said YouTube has also seen an uptick in videos being uploaded with “at home” in the title.
“I think it just speaks to the fact that Canadians and people around the world are staying home,” Cortellucci said."
Some heartbreaking stories of Healthy Chinese getting prejudiced by Filipinos over the Novel Corona Virus. 	"Ok this blog post is going to be touchy yet trending. And I’m posting this to remind myself and YOU dear readers that Chinese tourists are people too. No matter the bias and loathing some of their countrymen have done to us, there are still good people out there. Here are some truly heartbreaking stories posted on Facebook and collated by NerdRage’s boss Adrian Arcega.

Reading these stories really dropped my frustration over the antics of some of the mainlanders to a substantial level. They are human beings, they have feelings too and even if some of us are annoyed with how entitled they act, you can’t deny that don’t deserve this. Not all of them are infected. Some are just as scared of the NCoV as we are. What we need right now is kindness and compassion and a helping hand.
To end this post, let me quote Deku from My Hero Academia .
It’s like All-Might said… Giving help that’s not asked for… is what makes a true hero!” – Izuku Midoriya"
Corona virus explained. 	"People suffering from cases of Normalcy Bias are the ones who look around in the middle of a disaster and claim that they had no idea something could happen, no matter how much evidence was there beforehand.
Sadly, while these people are lamenting their situation, they’re not making any progress fixing their situations. While they sit around in disbelief that things have fallen apart, they’re also looking to see who is going to help them.
If someone does something or goes somewhere like a lamb to the slaughter, they do it without knowing that something bad is going to happen and therefore act calmly and without fighting against the situation.

On Islam The following passages were written in 1916 in Teddy Roosevelt’s book, “Fear God and Take Your Own Part”, reproduced in “What Every American Needs to Know About the Qur’an” by William Federer. Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight.Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. If the peoples of Europe in the seventh and eighth centuries, an on up to and including the seventeenth century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. Wherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor. …..The civilization of Europe, American and Australia exists today at all only because of the victories of civilized man over the enemies of civilization because of victories through the centuries from Charles Martel in the eighth century and those of John Sobieski in the seventeenth century. During the thousand years that included the careers of the Frankish soldier and the Polish king, the Christians of Asia and Africa proved unable to wage successful war with the Moslem conquerors; and in consequence Christianity practically vanished from the two continents; and today, nobody can find in them any “social values” whatever, in the sense in which we use the words, so far as the sphere of Mohammedan influences are concerned.There are such “social values” today in Europe, America and Australia only because during those thousand years, the Christians of Europe possessed the warlike power to do what the Christians of Asia and Africa had failed to do — that is, to beat back the Moslem invader. victorious with terror "" I have been made victorious with terror"" Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, ""I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand.""

With the recent Corona Virus outbreak I thought my dream from 2012 certainly fit.. 	With the recent Corona Virus outbreak I thought my dream from 2012 certainly fit. 11-04-27 Dream: I was walking on top of a grassy ridge. People were all around me. It felt like wartime and I could see soldiers all around us. It felt like Nazi Germany but I knew I was in the US somewhere. Tables were set up with small boxes open on the tables. I heard an air-raid siren wailing close by and the people started running towards the boxes. The boxes held surgical masks. The people were quickly putting them on and running down the hill to the ravine. Pup tents were set up and everyone was piling into them. Sensing the imminent danger I ran to the table grabbed a mask and ran down the hill. I went into the first tent I could find. Several young people were inside the tent panicking. A young girl was crying. We could hear the bombs squealing as they were dropping from the beautiful blue sky. A bomb dropped right beside us and I knew we were doomed. I heard a whirring sound from the bomb and thought it was a dispersant bomb that released some deadly virus or toxin. Some young guy grabbed a defenceless girl and held her up to protect himself from the bomb. What a spineless jerk I thought to myself and I grabbed her and put her behind me trying to protect her from the explosion. I awoke at this point and looked at the clock. It was just after 12am. I remembered the day before during prayer the Lord speaking to me saying by 12 that night he would speak to me concerning the things that are about to come. Posted by Joe Ouellette at 6:26 AM
nCoV-2019 codon usage and reservoi. 	"Great analysis. I look forward to the newspaper headlines proclaiming a fungal origin for nCoV-2019
Bo Xu ( http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Evolve/Bo_Xu.html ) has run the raw data from the JMedVirol paper through a PCA, which helps visualise what’s going on. If anyone wants the R code just shout.
Some notes from Bo on the interpretation of the correlation circle: (1) Positively correlated codons are grouped together. (2) Negatively correlated codons are on opposite sides of the plot origin. (3) The distance between codons and the origin measures the quality of the representation of the codons on the principal component (PC). A codon that is away from the origin (ie close to the circle circumference) is important for interpreting that component. Otherwise, the codon is close to the center of the circle.

I completely agree that no information about possible hosts of a virus can emerge from any analyses purporting to show that the codon usage of a particular virus most closely resembles that of a particular vertebrate species.
All of these analyses are ill-founded, for a simple reason that has not yet been made clear.
These analyses do not recognise that there is no single set of values that represent human (or snake) codon usage. Take human genes as an example: the G+C content at third positions of codons in human genes ranges from around 30% to around 90%. In A+T-rich genes A- and T-ending codons are used predominantly for all amino acids where there is a choice; in G+C-rich genes G- and C-ending codons are used predominantly for all amino acids where there is a choice (1). This variation is not related in any simple way to the tissue(s) in which a gene is expressed, nor to the level of gene expression; rather, it seems to be largely correlated with the base composition of the region of chromosome in which the gene is located. The favoured theory is that G+C content reflects the overall rate of recombination in that chromosome region, and in particular that gene conversion events are biased towards generating Gs and Cs (2).
[As an example, the alpha and beta globin genes are expressed at similar levels, at the same time, in the same tissue. Values of G+C content at silent sites in the alpha and beta globin genes are 92% and 65%, respectively, meaning the two genes have very different codon usage patterns (3). The alpha globin gene is on chromosome 16, the beta globin gene is on chromosome 11.]
Thus, simple codon usage compilations (such as those at the Kazusa Codon Usage Database) do not capture this enormous within-species heterogeneity of codon usage patterns, and present only an average pattern, that applies to few genes. There is far more difference in codon usage between different human genes, than there is between the average human pattern and the average pattern for any other mammal (or indeed any other vertebrate). The apparent difference, in this case, between compiled mammal and snake codon usage values, likely reflects the relatively small number of genes used for the snake compilation.
There is no evidence that codon usage in any vertebrate viruses have been under selection pressure to adapt to their hosts. But even if it was thought that this might happen, we have no clear expectation as to which, among the enormously diverse patterns of codon usage seen within any vertebrate, the virus should be selected to resemble.

CK Surgitech issued $25,200 in infringement notices for alleged breaches in relation to COVID-19 test kits . 	"24 April 2020 The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has issued two infringement notices totalling $25,200 to Queensland company CK Surgitech Pty Ltd for alleged breaches of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the Act) .
It is alleged the company made a false or misleading statement in an application to have their IVD Rapid Test kits for SARS-CoV2 (the COVID-19 virus) included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).
The company also allegedly breached a condition of the Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices - Accredited Pathology Laboratories) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (the Exemption) by importing COVID-19 test kits that were not included in the ARTG and were not being imported in relation to an authorised pathology laboratory as required by the Exemption.
COVID-19 test kits must not be imported into Australia, or manufactured or supplied in Australia, unless they are included in the ARTG or are subject to a relevant exemption, approval or authority.
Where medical devices are covered by the Exemption, the conditions of the Exemption must be complied with. A failure to do so is a criminal offence under section 41MNB of the Act and exposes the company or any relevant individual to a civil penalty under section 41MNC of the Act. For further information, see the TGA's advice on the legal supply of COVID-19 test kits .
The TGA regulates all medicines, medical devices and biologicals under the Act. Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, these contraventions are a cause of serious concern for the TGA. Any alleged breaches relating to products supplied as part of Australia's response to the pandemic will be given the highest priority by the TGA.
The regulatory scheme is important to the safety of Australians and the TGA investigates suspected illegal activity related to therapeutic goods. A range of compliance and enforcement actions detect, deter and address unlawful trade in unapproved therapeutic goods. Where appropriate this can involve criminal or civil court proceedings, which may result in substantial penalties, fines or imprisonment."
Coronavirus 2019-ncov to announce the End of Humankind?. 	"2020 has not even properly started and the world was shaken with USA – Iran conflict which was about to cause a world war III. After a few bombings in the area, Iran seemed to realise that USA is not an enemy to play with and due to a bad diplomatic approach things were made even worse by Iran when launching the attack on the Ukrainean plane.
In the same period of the year but more South, Australia was confronting with a huge bush fire that lasted for months and billions of wild animals and wild forests were burned to the ground. On top of these 2 major mediatic events, volcano eruptions were taking place in Philippines and most recently Indonesia. Coronavirus 2019- ncov and Conspiracy Theory
Some voices think that the Coronavirus outbreak was human made and was a major attack on China’s booming economy. It can be a valid theory considering other competitors willing to take China’s place in the hierarchy of superpowers. As China and Australia were closely connected some can blame USA or India for this massive outbreak.
Why not some might consider this a “war” made by Pharmaceutical Companies who will experience massive incomes and profits from antibiotic sales and other medicines used to treat the secondary effects of the virus.
Another Conspiracy theory could also be linked to a scenario we have seen in SF movies when a pandemic virus will affect the entire population and many will die, leaving only the rich and the super rich ones live as they afford paying for the vaccine that saves their lives. Coronavirus 2019-ncov Frenzy
Could media push too much against a phenomenon that may possibly not be that bad as it seems ? This can also be a valid way of thinking as mortality is not that high with the new Coronavirus and China has also a good experience with SARS epidemy.
“Marketing” on such a high scale makes people get very scared and can also cause homophobia against Asian people who by all means could be seen as carriers of the virus.
Media should be less invasive and treat the subject with more responsability seeing also the secondary effects that are about to happen. Coronavirus and Climate Change – Earth is telling us to STOP
More religious people could say that Coronavirus Outbreak is actually a sign from God, showing the humankind that we are not immortlas and we do not inherit the world in order to freely destroy it as our own will.
Climate change and massive polution in the world with plastic, fossils, Co2 and toxic gas caused by factories, cars and planes has made the weather become more and more severe and nature to be destroyed. Extinct animal species, Amazon Forest destroyed and North Pole temperature rising are just a few of the signs that our world, our live planet is in a critical state of health.
The new Storms affecting the UK, the Coronavirus Outbreak and the weather that is continously changing bringing more and more destructive changes is basically the immune system of our beautiful green planet that has started to act against us similar to antibodies attacking an antigen.
We can not go any further with this, polution needs to come to an end, airplanes need to be less and polute less, factories that polute need to be shut down and people should start living in a more natural and less aggressive way using technology to improve their comfort.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Fact versus fiction. 	"U.S. President Donald Trump's musings about whether disinfectants and ultraviolet light can be inserted into patients' bodies to treat COVID-19 have alarmed doctors and drawn warnings from the makers of Lysol, Dettol and Clorox.
Here are some other claims that have circulated about how to treat COVID-19 or stop the transmission of the new coronavirus, and the facts according to doctors and health experts:
TREATMENT
Fiction: Disinfectant injected into people infected with the new coronavirus could help clear COVID-19, the disease it causes.
Fact: Drinking or injecting bleach or other disinfectants is extremely dangerous and could result in death.
Fiction: Ultraviolet light inserted into the body could help kill the virus and speed recovery.
Fact: While UV light is known to kill viruses contained in droplets in the air, doctors say there is no way it could be introduced into the human body to target cells infected with COVID-19.
Fiction: Antibiotics can prevent and treat the new coronavirus.
Fact: Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. They will not prevent or treat infection with the new coronavirus.
There are currently no specific proven medicines for COVID-19 infection, but those infected can relieve and treat mild symptoms with over-the-counter fever-reducing medicines such as acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, and aspirin.
TRANSMISSION
Fiction: The new coronavirus can be spread by mosquito bites and in Chinese food.
Fact: No. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily via droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or breathes out, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.
PROTECTION
Fiction: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent infection with COVID-19.
Fact: There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people. There is some weak evidence that the practice can help some people recover more quickly from the common cold, but it does not prevent respiratory infections.
Fiction: Some social media posts suggest that spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body can protect against COVID-19 infection, or that gargling bleach or drinking excessive amounts of water can somehow ""flush it out.""
Fact: There is no evidence to back these claims.
Good hygiene practices including frequent hand washing and avoiding close social contact can help reduce the risk of infection.
Fiction: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus.
Fact: No. Hand dryers are not effective against COVID-19, but frequently cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub, or washing them with soap and water, is. Clean hands should be dried thoroughly with a clean towel or air dryer.
Fiction: Cold weather, hot weather, snow, eating garlic or taking a hot bath have also been suggested as ways people can prevent themselves from becoming infected.
Fact: There is no evidence behind these claims and no evidence as yet to suggest that COVID-19 will be affected by weather or the seasons.
The best way to protect yourself is by washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with anyone who might be infected. This way, you can eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that might occur by touching your eyes, mouth and nose."

Does C5 Have The Corona Virus? Maybe. We’ll Never Know. 	"With Your Feverish, Contagious and Mildly Narcissistic Host, Category5.
Well, There is a click bait title if I ever saw one.
I had a plan. Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face.
So much for the Mask, Glasses and Gloves… and ubber prepper respectability. We are both sick as dogs and this has been dragging on. Just when I think its over, it keeps coming back. I am writing in between fevers.
In spite of our glam shots in the previous article, https://darkgreenmountainsurvivalresearchcentre.wordpress.com/2020/02/05/c5s-tales-from-the-hot-zone-24-hours-in-a-mask-sucks-literally/ it looks like we got tagged. It’s probably NOT the corona virus. Then again, there is a better than average chance that it might be. Canadian Health Services has let us down in a truly head shaking way we will get to later.
It’s hard to not to be mildly superstitious at times like these, being an apocalyptic prophet and all that. Teaching tool of The Gods.
Seriously. What are the odds.
In my last article, I pointed out that though masks, gloves and glasses were a first line of defense, that it was also placebo. False sense of security. I think we have officially proven that. We might have got tagged by Asian guy coughing behind us in the line up. Sucks to be Asian at the moment. It could have been several other sick people on the assorted planes we boarded. Its a good time to be canceling traveling plans. Any place travelers pass though and congregate is a HOT ZONE on the best of days. Air Canada is also on both of our Shit Lists at the moment. I am outing them because I am a vengeful person. I’ll get to that also in a bit.
Quarantine in a well pre-stocked home is your only real defense.
C5 Survival Quik Tip. Go to the store after reading this. Do it soon. Go pick up a few boxs of NeoCitren hot drink mix or some off brand version. You want to do it now in case there is a run on it. Don’t Horde. Just get what your family needs. If you stocked up before hand, its not hording. Its proper pre planning. If you do it at this point when there is a need…ITS HORDING. If you horde for resale at a heavy mark up at this point, I got no problem with someone waking you up in the middle night by pouring gasoline on you and lighting a smoke. I mentioned I am a vicious fellow.
We had some on hand because we have pre planned medical supplies… and we buy on sale.
And this is where I get to tell you that we suck at times and are not the ultimate preppers… and the teaching tool of the gods. I was shocked to find out we only had two boxes. There might or might not be another kicking around as we are not super organized. The problem is that we had used it up in previous illnesses, hadn’t restocked… and hadn’t noticed. Ild head there now if I could summon the strength. I cant. COUGH!
Night Time NeoCytren is the important one because you want to sleep as much as you can. The Day Time version is also important if you absolutely must get up and need the kick to not die or care for others.
And a prepper related issue others dont think about. When I saw I was hit and before I got too week to move, My final act was to move the car down the hill to the road and walk back up before collapsing. Good thing I did. Somewhere in between then, delirium and now, we were snowed in. Also, I was having trouble keeping the wood fire fed. As well as the animals. Luckily we have no shortage of food on hand. Too bad I have no apatite to eat it. We have been able to eat ice cream. Canned chicken soup at the start… but not now. We force down what we can when the Ibbeprophen kicks in.
And now for the Rapidly Changing News. You should be checking MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. Things Keep Changing. Info keeps changing.
Lets start here. I’m cutting Canadian Prepper some slack today. We are not always on the same page. As preppers go, he is a semi respectable prepper. No need to challenge him today as I would lose in a fight with a toddler. COUGH
The person he is referencing is this guy.
And he is pointing out a lot about what Chris Martenson was sounding the alarm about. This is already old news by several days… but in case you missed it, it looks like it may have jumped to airborne. Not good.
He keeps being proven right… but he gets a double tap. Perhaps you missed this story. He came under attack by the WTO and media. In fact, if you go to the YouTube page The WTO forced in a link to his page. Now who would want to pick on nice guy, Chris. M. He must have hit a nerve.
Soooo…..Here is our own story of stupid… and why the numbers dont tell the whole story.
MrsC5 got sick before me by a couple of days. Probably spread it to me. Because we had been to a world nexus… and a lot of Chinese got out before the lock down, MrsC5 Good Samaritaned it and called the Nova Scotia health hotline to talk with a Nurse Practitioner. After the story and symptoms, The NP said, “I want you to go to the Emergency and get a swab done right now. Did you hear and understand me. Don’t wait till later. Don’t think about it. Go now.”
I was just getting muscle achy at that point so I drove. She went through the highly painful experience of having three plus inches of swab jammed down here navel cavity. 3 times.
There is a nasal triple penetration joke in there somewhere… but I’m getting nothing.
After the weekend was over, we called back for the results. When they finally got back to us, we were informed they didn’t and wouldn’t be sending it for testing. That they were only doing tests if we had been to Wuhan. Now, that’s Tax money well spent. Plus we potentially infected our local Hospital and a small town filled with old people. Look, Its most likely a Central American flu and it just hitting us hard because we haven’t been hit by those before.
But We’ll Never Know. You will never know. The local doctors will know too late… and most importantly, if we did get it, the Government approved statistics will never know. Take that as you will.
The Official death toll is over 1100 at the time of writing.
But just a thought to keep you focused on the bigger picture. While 1100+ people just died…. At the time of writing, since the beginning of the year, the world population has increased by 9 and a half million budding new consumers. What did you think was going to happen.
Its good to just stare at this occasionally, to keep you suitably frightened… and think though some of the “Solutions” the Right demand to obscure action and the Left naively throw out placating themselves from action. We are riding this train all the way, baby.

Well, lets continue my roll as the bad boy of the prepper world. I notice a random comment on The Dinner in reference to Carolyn Baker, Richard Hienberg and others. Nearingsfault, a prepper I actually respect commented….
“Not my scene. Lots of really cozy well fed well read people very in touch with their feelings. Give me a good foul mouthed skinned knuckle dooer like C5 anyday…”
Cam, a newly collapse aware young person that I will write an article for all to read, responded,…
” I love C5’s writing. He doesn’t beat around the bush and he’s pretty funny too. ”
I think I have got an appropriate song to go along with the subject… and bush beating. Shall I tell them about the R- Rated part, other C5. I think Not. Oh, you will know the exact moment I burst out laughing myself. Ah, My peeps.
Well, its time to Kick Ass, Take Names… and hopefully lower a heartless and irresponsible corporations stock price.
Did I mention yet that I have a vindictive side.
Air Canada. You’ve Made My Shit List.
Hopefully you caught the subtle transition from L7s other well known song. Never mind.
A close friend of MrsC5 had died and she had booked a cheap flight on Air Canada. Then all this happened. MrsC5 called to find out if if things could be changed or rebooked. There should be some bending over backwards to accommodate wold events. She was informed they didn’t care and we had just lost the 700$.
Here is the part to pay attention to. MrsC5 then said she was going to take the flight anyhow. She was delirious with fever at the time.
Air Canada didn’t care and would of let her on the plane anyhow. Your safety is not their business.
MrsC5 couldn’t stay upright so she missed the plane. She could have been in the sky as I write. Now, Think about that. How many people the world over cant afford to throw away 700$ and would get on that plane anyhow because they had no option. A lot.
So, I wouldn’t get on a Plane any time soon. Air Canada, FUCK YOU.
As Bruce Lee Used to say, “Always Bet On The Street”
One last thing before I go. There IS a lot of conspiracy theories that have popped up from the usual Black Helicopter, New World Order trying to take our guns, Alien Anal Probe, The LEFT wants to turn our children gay, Chemtrail and Agenda 21, vocal retard crowd.
Now I’m just curious. I’m going to start a conspiracy theory right here and now… just to see if it takes off and how fast. Let me state now, I dont think this. I’m Making it up.
Donald Trump released the weaponized Corona Virus to help with the Trade WAR. His intent was to MAKE AMERICA THE LAST COUNTRY STANDING AGAIN. This was to distract from his impeachment… and even if he had been impeached, he would have succeeded in his long term goal of genocide. This would also improve his re election campaign, playing to his anti China, anti immigrant base, while increasing surveillance spending and setting up a permanent emergency to suspend elections.
Here is the proof, Donald Trump was in China for Trade Talks November 8-10 with a mixed entourage of government agents and his Mob Tied Lawyers. This was how it was snuck into the country. It was passed to US funded dissidents, taken away from the scene of the crime and released in its intended location, Tuesday, December 31. The location was near a Chinese Bio Weapons base, in a double reverse blame shift.
Then an insider let it slip as he bragged in public, now knowing Trump was untouchable from legal challenge or accountability. Trump Insider and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, bagged about the plot and how this would help American companies and punish those that used China’s supply chain. Follow the money. Then they fired pentagon whistle blowers that weren’t loyal in case the plot got to them. In Hubris, Trump thought it could be contained in China so he praised China’s draconian measures and has stayed quiet about its police state.
Now I don,t believe a word of this but like any good con, its based on using a lot of true facts, carefully arranged to to tell a plausible story . It would have more power if I claimed it over and over and say it either through manufactured outrage or putting it out as secret insider knowledge revield. This is what the government doesn’t want you to know. It works best on populations that are struggling and want to know the secret truth of why.
Why am I telling you this? High Paid Right Wing Think Tanks and political operatives make this shit up every day. Then it is sent out by an army of trolls and an even bigger army of bots. Its called Gas Lighting and its intention is to get people to doubt there own experience. Its a form of control.
And you are exposed to that every day. Heck. I pulled that story line together wile feverish. Just think what I could accomplish with malicious intent.
I’m also pointing this out because preppers, gun folk and the religious are particular targets to this type of manipulation. I’m just doing my part to help you understand how this works and hopefully you can start to see behind the curtain.
I’m feeling much better since starting this, this morning. Hopefully I have built some new immunity. MrsC5 is still down and struggling… and she started a couple days before me.

Normal Flu Versus Corona Virus.. 	"Up to 79,400 people died from sickness during the flu seasons in 2017-2018. 61,200 died in 2018-2019.
This is the published data from the CDC. Yes, I’m aware that the CDC has a bad reputation of being a vaccine marketer, and vaccines in some cases are deadly, but some of the research that goes through the CDC is reliable, and we shouldn’t throw all that research away on a whim. Some things need to be saved and some others discarded.
For example: Companies that need to be discarded.

Corona Virus: Don't Allow This Animal Into Your Homes. 	"Pangolins
Coronavirus is linked to the novel disease found in pangolins!
It was 99% identical to the strain found in infected people. The research has found that they are ‘the most likely intermediate host’ of coronavirus, which has spread to 25 countries.
Since pangolins emerged at a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in December.It's been a suspect carrier!
This latest discovery however, will be of great importance for the prevention and control of the origin of the virus. Investigations are still ongoing.
Some scientists broadly agree that coronavirus may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.
However, everyone should avoid this most trafficked animal as well as eating bats link to humans via food markets."
Corona Virus may bring down Red China. 	"Not with nukes. Not with the 82nd Airborne. Not even with a president standing there and say, ""Chairman Xi, tear down this wall."" But with a bug.
Red China has the flu. The communist regime stands in peril this afternoon, helplessly, as the Corona Virus holds its economy hostage. Factories are closed, which interrupts the supply chain for the American companies which provide the trade surplus that finances the totalitarian state. Companies already seeking alternatives (thanks to President Donald John Trump's tariffs) are looking harder today for more reliable sources.
Nothing personal, just business. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola got that right.
The Associated Press reported , ""China remained mostly closed for business Tuesday, as the daily death toll from a new virus topped 100 for the first time, pushing the total above 1,000.
""Despite the official end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday, many remained at home on Tuesday with around 60 million people under virtual quarantine.
""Authorities in Hong Kong evacuated people from an apartment block where four were found to be infected, raising fears the virus may be spreading through plumbing, similar to what happened in 2003′s deadly SARS outbreak.""
The flu shut down factories and Xi is reeling. Bloomberg News reported , ""China’s efforts to contain the Corona Virus are rippling far beyond Hubei province, the epicenter of the disease. At 4.6 trillion yuan ($660 billion) in 2019, Hubei’s economy is bigger than Poland’s or Sweden’s and accounts for 4.6% of China’s national gross domestic product.""
Tariffs compound the problem.
Bloomberg News reported, ""For factories in China that make lower-end goods such as furniture and cheap phones, the Corona Virus is the latest in a series of existential threats. Already operating on paper-thin margins because of rising labor and materials costs, these businesses sustained another blow from the tariffs the Trump administration levied on $360 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S.""
The Chi-Comm economy is motionless. Xi's secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters, ""Without the reopening of businesses, in the short term, it will affect the supply of medical material and ... in the long run, it will affect the supply of all kinds of production and life materials and will make the control and prevention efforts on the front line unsustainable. The target of defeating the epidemic will not be reached.""
President Donald John Trump pounced.
The Associated Press reported, ""Among a growing number of travel restrictions, the U.S. said that, as of Monday, it had suspended regular visa services at the embassy in Beijing and consulates general in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang. The Consulate General in Wuhan has already been closed and its staff evacuated.
""A presidential proclamation issued Feb. 2 banned entry to the U.S. to foreigners or non-permanent residents who had been in China fewer than 14 days prior to their arrival. Exceptions were made for foreign diplomats, flight crew and family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.""
Worried communist sympathizers in our country are calling this xenophobic.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg News also reported, ""Bloomberg Economics estimates that if the outbreak is successfully contained, the impact on China’s economy will be severe but short-lived -- with growth slowing to 4.5% in the first quarter, followed by a recovery and then stabilization in the second half. That trajectory would put full-year growth in 2020 at 5.7%, which is 0.2 percentage point below Bloomberg Economics’ forecast prior to the outbreak and down from 6.1% in 2019. If it takes longer to come under control, the hit to growth would be bigger.""
David Ni is the chief executive of Jiangsu Siborui Import and Export Co. headquartered in the Yangtze port city of Nanjin. The company buys aluminum alloy wheels for cars from Chinese producers and exports them to retail outlets in the U.S.
He told Bloomberg News, ""We are missing our peak sales season."" He also said, ""There’s little factory owners can do except wait. On and off, the epidemic could delay production for at least two months. Most factories this year wouldn’t be able to make any money.""
The story said, ""None of its suppliers have gone back to work yet, and it’s unclear when they will, says Ni, who’s based in Los Angeles.""
And Red China has another flu-related problem. CNBC reported , ""Mongolia has suspended deliveries of coal across its southern border into China until March 2, Reuters reported Monday, citing the country’s National Emergency Commission.
""The move is designed to prevent the spread of the Corona Virus, with the commission also recommending the country suspend its Tsagaan Sar Lunar New Year celebrations later this month. Mongolia has not yet reported any cases of the Corona Virus.""
And of course, Red China's tourism industry is dead for now, and will likely have a slow recovery. The cruise industry worldwide also will suffer a hit.
Red China's foreign customers may be the least of Xi's worries. The Wall Street Journal reported, ""The Chinese leader also faces anger and frustration over the government’s response to the outbreak, emotions that swelled Friday with the death from the virus of Li Wenliang, a young doctor punished for trying to raise an early alarm.
""In the province of Hubei, the center of the outbreak, hospitals are overwhelmed, medical and food supplies depleted, and some 60 million people are held under the largest quarantine in history. The virus first emerged in December in the industrial city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.
""While much of the nation’s anger is directed at local authorities, blamed for trying to cover up the outbreak, many people also are channeling fury at the censorship and rigid, centralized authority that Mr. Xi has galvanized over the past seven years.""
Part of the problem is the public does not trust the media, which means it does not trust the regime. This spoils communication.
Glenn Reynolds wrote , ""Well, perhaps the Chinese officials are lying, but perhaps they’re telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
""Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.""
Peons will put up with a lot from their government. A flu epidemic, though, is not on that list of things the serfs suffer in silence."
Time for homeopaths to join fight against corona Virus to show that Nosodes works. 	"Time for homeopaths to join fight against corona Virus to show that Nosodes works
Dr K K Aggarwal President Heart Care Foundation of India
It’s the time for the homeopaths all over the world to join fight against corona virus and show that the concept of nosode works.
Modern Medicine use vaccines for prevention and they have none for the current corona virus. A “Vaccine” is any substance used in active immunization. “Active immunization” is the inoculation, usually by injection of a special antigen to promote antibody production. These may be dead bacteria (e.g. Typhoid), dead viruses (e.g. Salk polio), live viruses (e.g. Sabin’s polio), or toxoids (e.g. Tetanus or Diphtheria).
Homoeopathy had its own theory regarding vaccination. It never introduces pathogenic microorganisms into the body, so its medicine cannot strictly be called vaccines. The equivalent are Nosodes, which have a prophylactic or preventative effect. They are always taken orally. These Nosodes are prepared by a process of diluting and succession, called potentization, so that there is no trace of the original pathogen remaining.
A nosode (from nosos, the Greek word meaning disease) is a homeopathic preparation made from matter from a sick animal or person. Substances such as respiratory discharges or diseased tissues are used. The preparation, using alcohol, as well as the repeated dilution and succession, essentially renders the substances harmless, while producing a powerful remedy.
Homeopathy is a science where the matter is converted into nonmatter before it is used in the clinical practice.
During the 200-year history of Homoeopathy, this form of medicine has proved to be extraordinarily effective in preventing and curing epidemic disease. Dr Samuel Hahnemann had great success in treating epidemics of scarlet fever. Villages treated with his prophylactics entirely escaped dreaded epidemics, including the Plague.
""The Journal of the American Institute for Homeopathy, May 1921, had a long article about the use of homeopathy in the flu epidemic. Dr. T A McCann, from Dayton, Ohio reported that 24,000 cases of flu treated allopathically had a mortality rate of 28.2% while 26,000 cases of flu treated homeopathically had a mortality rate of 1.05%.
This last figure was supported by Dean W.A. Pearson of Philadelphia (Hahnemann College) who collected 26,795 cases of flu treated with homeopathy with the above result. Dr. Herbert A. Roberts from Derby, CT, said that 30 physicians in Connecticut responded to his request for data. They reported 6,602 cases with 55 deaths, which is less than 1%. Dr. Roberts was working as a physician on a troop ship during WWI. He had 81 cases of flu on the way over to Europe. He reported, ""All recovered and were landed. Every man received homeopathic treatment. One ship lost 31 on the way.""--- Julian Winston
Nosodes have been used in prophylaxis. Examples would be the use of Influenzinum in flu prophylaxis or Morbillinum in a measles epidemic. Closely related to this would be the use of the sarcode Anas barbare hepatis et cardus extractum (liver and heart of the Barbary duck) for 'flu. Derived from tissues of the native host of influenza, this remedy is prepared from tissue containing and reacting to the influenza virus.
For preparing Nosodes specific perpetrations are used in the prevention of corresponding diseases. e.g. - Morbillinum - Measles, Variolinum - Smallpox, Influenzinum - Influenza, Diphtherinum - Diphtheria
Dr. H.C. Allen notes about the use of Diphtherinum, ""The author has used it for twenty-five years as a prophylactic and has never known a second case of diphtheria to occur in a family after it had been administered"".
Homeopathic preparations have not been shown to raise antibody levels. Smits tested the titer of antibodies to diphtheria, polio and tetanus in ten children before and one month after giving homeopathic preparations of these three vaccines (DTPol 30K and 200K). He found no rise in antibody levels (Smits, 1995). He speculates that protection afforded by a homeopathic remedy acts on a ""deeper"" level than that of antibodies.
Homoeopathic remedies reduce the patient's sensitivity to the dynamic stimulus of the virus or bacteria, thus lessening the patient's predisposition to being overcome by this stimulus"" (Golden, 1994).
If homeopathic remedies do not produce an increase in antibody levels, then the only way to measure the effectiveness of homeopathic prophylaxis is through clinical results.
In modern medicine a similar concept has been used in making a lung cancer nosode equivalent by repeatedly radiating the lung cancer tissue. I personally has seen many anecdote cases that nosode works."

Nightclub Apologizes for Promoting 'Corona Chinese New Year' Party During Virus Outbreak. 	"A nightclub and promotion company in Australia have apologized for hosting a “Corona Chinese New Year Special” amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 500 people.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald and AU ABC News, promotion company Mr. Chan’s was set to host the event at Pawn & Co, which is located in Melbourne, on Friday night.
Mr. Chan’s advertised the event beforehand, offering a limited-edition face mask and $8 Corona beers. They also promoted it through an Instagram post that featured a graphic of a man in a cartoon rice hat holding a beer with a face mask covering his mouth.
Anthony Leong, president of the Chinese-Australia Friendship Association, called the event “ignorant, racist and insensitive,” before it was canceled, which led to Mr. Chan’s and Pawn & Co issuing apologies, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.
“We recognize that a promotional post that was made last week was offensive and we unreservedly apologize for this,” Mr. Chan’s said, according to the newspaper.
Pawn & Co also apologized, but seemed to distance itself from Mr. Chan’s.
“From the team at Pawn & Co, we would like to unreservedly apologize for the insensitive and inappropriate marketing that has been circulated from Mr Chan’s,” the statement said, according to both outlets. “Whilst it is an external promotional company that owns the Mr Chan’s brand, we acknowledge that we should have been more active in understanding the communication being marketed and how it might be perceived.”
Mr. Chan’s and Pawn & Co have deleted their Instagram and Facebook accounts.
As of Wednesday, there have been 24,324 cases of coronavirus in China, and 490 people have died from the respiratory illness. Twelve cases have been confirmed the United States. On Friday, the Trump administration announced a ban on non-U.S. citizens arriving from China, and said it will quarantine any Americans who came from Hubei in the last 14 days. All flights from China are being required to go to 11 airports with enhanced health screenings.

Still, the Centers for Disease Control emphasizes that the average American is at a “low” risk of developing this coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, and that the seasonal flu is more of a threat.
“Our guidance is that at this time of year, the best things you can do are the things that we generally recommend at this time of year to prevent the spread of infectious diseases,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC said Thursday. “Wash your hands, cover your cough, take care of yourself, and keep alert to the information that we’re providing, because we’ll provide new information as it becomes available.”"

Hawaii health authorities began a search on Friday for anyone who may have had close contact with a Japanese tourist who fell ill on the island of Oahu and tested positive for a new coronavirus soon after returning to his home country, news agency Reuters reported. The case came to public attention at a Honolulu news conference by Governor David Ige and senior state health officials, who said the man in question is believed to have become infected in Japan before embarking on his trip, or while en route to Hawaii. That assumption is based on the 14-day incubation period of the virus, and the fact that the man became symptomatic after less than a week in Hawaii, the state health officials said.
Saturday marked the second day the number of new coronavirus fell since Thursday when China's Hubei province began including clinical diagnoses in its official count. Using the wider scope of classification, the province reported 15,152 cases, including 13,332 that were diagnosed using doctors’ analyses and lung imaging, as opposed to the prior standard of laboratory testing. Hubei health authorities said in the notice that the new method was adopted to facilitate earlier treatment for those suspected of infection.

Another Alachua County resident dies from COVID-19. 	"The Alachua County Health Department is confirming one death in Alachua County earlier this week from COVID-19, but one local family said their mother, who died yesterday, is the county's second death from coronavirus.

Her family said she spent the last three weeks at Shands Hospital fighting for her life, but yesterday, she died from COVID-19.
Ella Mae Gordon's daughter, Dorothy Christian, said they had one last opportunity to tell her how much they loved her.
Dorothy Christian’s mother was a resident at Parkland Nursing home, and every resident at the nursing home was tested for COVID-19.
She said initially her mother tested negative. She was at the nursing home, where no visitors were allowed, but weeks later, she got sick and tested positive.
There's still some uncertainty on how her mother contracted the virus, which is why she feels, it's too early for the city to start opening businesses up. ""We lost our mother,"" she said, ""and she had to die alone.""

6 cases were reported in Korea. 	"The temperature topped 100 degrees F (38 degrees Celsius) in the first of the Australian Open women’s semifinals and got slightly warmer in the second, when Garbiñe Muguruza and Simona Halep were going shot-for-shot in the hot-hot sun.
The sudden burst of heat got very, very close to triggering the top level of the tournament’s extreme heat policy, which means suspending play and closing the retractable roofs on the show courts and, more or less, making it indoors.
That would have suited two-time major champion Halep, a runner-up in Melbourne in 2018.
“Yes, it was very, very hot today and I felt it,” the fourth-seeded Halep said after losing 7-6 (8), 7-5, despite being a point away from winning both sets. “Killed me after the first set. The sun was strong. I didn’t like that much to play in this weather.”
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 meaning it’s mandatory for the roof to be closed, it reached 4.9 while Muguruza and Halep were playing on Thursday afternoon. The temperature edged up to 102 degrees F ( 39 degrees C ).
“Conditions were tough out there,” Muguruza said, adding that she had primed herself to deal it.
“I asked if it was opened or closed. They told me it’s not enough to close it,” she said. “I’m like, ‘OK, well ... I’m going to have to suffer out there.’”
Sofia Kenin grew up in Florida, and said she had no problem with the heat in her 7-6 (6), 7-5 semifinal win over top-ranked Ash Barty , an Aussie who is also used to the hot conditions. The so-called Heat Stress Reading — that scale from 1-5 — was on 4.3 when their match started.
Melbourne’s fickle weather regularly generates news during the season’s first major, but the start of the decade has brought some extremes.
Day 11 was by far the hottest so far in a tournament. Until then, relatively mild temperatures — in terms of the Australian summer, at least — followed a few rainy days. The rain — it was dirty red one day when the wet weather pushed through a dust storm — helped alleviate the terrible air quality that affected the qualifying tournament because of smoke from devastating bush fires to the north and east of Melbourne.
It’ll be a furnace Friday, with Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology forecasting temperatures in parts of Melbourne to hit 109 degrees F (43 degrees C) before a cooler change — possibly in time for the second men’s semifinal match between Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev .
Then the slide is expected to begin, with maximum forecast temperatures of 91 degrees C (33 degrees C) on Saturday — when Kenin and Muguruza are set to meet in the women’s final — 73 degrees F (23 degrees C) on Sunday for the men’s final and down to 64 degrees F (18 degrees C) to start next week.

DROUGHT CONTINUES
The drought will extend another year for Aussies at the season-opening Grand Slam event.
Ash Barty doesn’t think hometown pressure was a factor in her semifinal loss to Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open.
The top-ranked Barty, who won the French Open last year after losing in the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park, had set points in both sets against the 21-year-old American, who was into the semifinals at a major for the first time.
“She played the biggest points well,” Barty said Friday. “Sofia came out and played aggressively on those points and deserved to win.
“I felt like I was scrapping and trying to find what I wanted to do best and came within a couple of points of winning the match. Yeah, sometimes it falls your way, sometimes it doesn’t. That’s just sport. That’s life.”
Barty, holding her weeks-old niece, Olivia, on her knee, acknowledged at a news conference there had been plenty of local attention on her run, t he first by an Australian woman to the semifinals of the Australian Open since Wendy Turnbull in 1984 . There hasn’t been a homegrown winner of the singles title since 1978.
“I’ve been in a Grand Slam semifinal before. Yes, it’s different at home. I enjoyed the experience,” Barty said. “I mean, if you would have told me three weeks ago that we would have won a tournament in Adelaide, made the semifinals of the Australian Open, I’d take that absolutely every single day.”

RETURNING THE FAVOR
All the way back when she was 7, Sofia Kenin was trying to work out ways to compete with the top players in the world.
After advancing to her first Grand Slam final by beating top-ranked Ash Barty at the Australian Open, Kenin said she had been dreaming of this moment since she was a kid.
She made a passing reference to a video posted by Tennis Channel of her talking about how to unpick former No. 1-ranked Andy Roddick’s weapon.
In it, a 7-year-old Kenin says the secret was in how to return his serve and explains how: “If I split, and then I turn around and hit my forehand with my short swing.”
Kenin, who was born in Moscow in 1998 and moved to Florida as a baby, was a child when Roddick won the U.S. Open in 2003 . He also reached four other Grand Slam finals.
“I think everyone knows about it. I’m doing an interview thing, I can return his serve, how I will return it,” the 21-year-old American said. “By the way, he tweeted something about me. He said congratulations and stuff, so ... Thank you, Andy.”

DJOKOVIC ON COURT
Novak Djokovic had just reached a record eighth Australian Open final when he was asked why it seemed to be only long-retired players who were leading the campaign to have Margaret Court Arena renamed.
It has been a contentious issue at Melbourne Park because of Court’s controversial comments on homosexuality and gay marriage. Djokovic didn’t take sides.
John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova this week unfurled a sign on the court asking it to be renamed in honor of Evonne Goolagong . They later apologized for breaching tournament protocol, but not for their campaign.
Djokovic said he had seen the photo of McEnroe and Navratilova with the banner but wasn’t well-enough informed about their protest to make a judgement. He also said he understood that people were hurt by comments from the 77-year-old Court, who became a religious minister after winning an all-time record 24 Grand Slam singles titles.
“Margaret is a huge champion, a tennis hero in Australia, and also around the world. One of the most important tennis players in the history of women’s game,” Djokovic said. “Of course, when she says something like that, it has a huge impact.
“I don’t support ... what she said. I don’t think it was the right thing to say. But she probably has her reasons and we have to respect that she has a difference in opinion. That’s all there is to it.”

Kenin of US ousts No. 1 Barty to reach Australian Open final
By HOWARD FENDRICH, January 30, 2020
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — So long in the shadows of other American tennis players, Sofia Kenin is into her first Grand Slam final at age 21 -- and she beat the woman ranked No. 1 to get there.
Kenin did it by never flinching, even when she twice was a single point from losing each set of her Australian Open semifinal against Ash Barty before pulling out the 7-6 (6), 7-5 victory in a stiflingly hot semifinal Thursday.
“This really wasn’t an easy one,” said the 14th-seeded Kenin, who never had been past the fourth round at a major tournament until now.
Kenin, who was born in Russia and moved to Florida as a baby, burst onto the scene in 2019 by winning three singles titles and upsetting Serena Williams in the third round of the French Open.
She didn’t face a seeded player in this tournament until Thursday, but did eliminate 15-year-old sensation Coco Gauff in the fourth round.
This was not Barty’s first foray onto this stage: She won the French Open last June, beating Kenin along the way. But Barty was hardly at her best, especially at the most crucial moments, perhaps overwhelmed by the task of trying to become the first Australian woman to reach the final of the country’s Grand Slam tournament since 1980.
Instead, Kenin is the first American other than a Williams sister to reach the Australian Open final since Lindsay Davenport in 1995. And Kenin is the first American woman to beat the No. 1 player at a major since Serena topped Venus at Wimbledon in 2002.
On Saturday, Kenin will go up against either No. 4 Simona Halep or unseeded Garbiñe Muguruza. That pair of two-time major champions and former No. 1s were to face each other in Thursday’s second semifinal.
“I’m not even going to look,” Kenin said of the other semifinal. “I’m just going to relax and enjoy this moment. I’m just looking forward to the final.”
In the men’s semifinals, defending champion Novak Djokovic was scheduled to play Roger Federer for the 50th time on Thursday night, with No. 5 Dominic Thiem meeting No. 7 Alexander Zverev in a matchup between 20-somethings on Friday night.
Barty and Kenin stepped out in Rod Laver Arena in the early afternoon under a cloudless sky and a vibrant sun. The temperature topped 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the first set, 20 to 25 (10 to 15) degrees hotter than it’s been for much of a chillier-than-usual 1½ weeks so far at Melbourne Park.
“It was tough. I haven’t played in this heat for two weeks (but) I expected it today,” Kenin said. “I’m from Miami. I’m used to this weather. The heat didn’t bother me.”
Barty braced herself by wearing an ice towel around her neck at changeovers.
In addition to making it uncomfortable for players and fans alike, the new conditions caused balls to zip through the air and fly off rackets, rendering it that much harder to control shots. Add that to jitters and iffy footwork at times from both women, and neither was at her best for much of the opening set.
Barty’s one-handed slice backhand was not as reliable as it normally is. Kenin’s movement and groundstrokes seemed to lack their usual verve.
It took Kenin 43 minutes to register just one forehand winner, while 11 of her initial 14 points resulted from unforced errors by Barty.
Barty had nearly twice as many winners in the first set, 22-12, thanks in large part to her eight aces, and she gathered more total points, too: 46-44. But that doesn’t matter at all in tennis, of course.
Barty was a point from taking that set when she went up 6-4 in the tiebreaker by slapping a 78 mph second serve with a forehand return winner, prompting Kenin to bounce her racket off the blue court and shake her head.
Maybe that helped her release some tension, because she wouldn’t lose another point in the set.
Barty’s first set point was wasted with a netted backhand, eliciting a collective “A !” from the seats. The second was erased when Kenin ripped a good return, followed by a forehand that wrong-footed Barty. Another winner by Kenin, this one a swinging forehand volley, put her ahead 7-6 for her first set point. Barty then missed a runaround forehand, ending the set; Kenin shouted “Come on!”
Not ready to concede, Barty recovered quickly, earning the match’s first break, 70 minutes in, en route to a 3-1 lead in the second set. That grew to 5-3, and she served for it at 5-4, but stumbled once more.
Kenin didn’t drop another game.

Djokovic adds to Slam streak vs. Federer at Australian Open
By HOWARD FENDRICH, January 30, 2020
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Novak Djokovic was wondering, right along with everyone else, what sort of shape Roger Federer would be in for their Australian Open semifinal.
At age 38, despite dealing with a painful groin muscle and coming off a draining five-setter, Federer came out just fine, it seemed, and soon was up 4-1 and love-40, holding a trio of break chances as Djokovic served.
Didn’t last. Federer couldn’t sustain that level. Neither his body nor Djokovic would let him.
Casting aside a bit of a poor start during the rivals’ 50th meeting, Djokovic stretched his Grand Slam winning streak against Federer to six in a row with a 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3 victory Thursday night that earned the defending champion a record eighth trip to the final at Melbourne Park.
“Today was horrible, to go through what I did. Nice entrance. Nice sendoff. And in between, it’s one to forget, because you know you have a 3% chance to win,” Federer said, adding that he discussed beforehand with his team how bad things would need to get for him to stop playing. “Once you can see it coming, that it’s not going to work anymore, it’s tough.”
Djokovic now leads their head-to-head series 27-23, including 11-6 at majors. Federer hasn’t beaten him at one of the sport’s four most important tournaments since 2012.
“I just want to say, respect to Roger for coming out tonight. He was obviously hurt,” Djokovic said. “Wasn’t at his best.”
The No. 2-seeded Djokovic will try to collect a record-extending eighth Australian Open title on Sunday against No. 5 Dominic Thiem or No. 7 Alexander Zverev.
Djokovic also can claim a 17th major trophy overall to move closer to Federer’s record of 20. Rafael Nadal, beaten by Thiem in the quarterfinals, is at 19.
In the women’s final Saturday, it’ll be two-time major champion Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain against 21-year-old Sofia Kenin of the United States. It’s Kenin’s debut in a Grand Slam title match.
Clearly, for Djokovic vs. Federer, everything hinged on the first hour or so.
They played on a muggy, sweltering evening, with the temperature in the high 90s (high 30s Celsius) and no breeze to offer respite.
Almost from the moment his wild quarterfinal ended Tuesday after he’d saved seven match points and eked past Tennys Sandgren in five sets, speculation swirled about how well Federer would recover.
Might the muscle issue force him to pull out of the tournament? Why didn’t he practice Wednesday?
As it happens, Federer showed up, of course. And gave what he could until the end.
He’s never handed an opponent a walkover across more than 400 Grand Slam matches, never retired from any of his more than 1,500 career tour-level matches.
“I don’t think I would have gone on court if I had no chance to win,” Federer said. “We saw I was still able to make a match out of it.”
Indeed, Federer appeared to be managing just fine at the outset.
And, oh, did this match set out well, in terms of the atmosphere, in terms of the tension, in terms of the tennis.
The proceedings began with a jolt of a 14-point game as a fugue of “Let’s go, Roger!” and “No-le! No-le!” provided the soundtrack, prompting chair umpire Nico Helwerth to passively aggressively admonish spectators: “Please. Thank you.”
There was an exchange of 17 strokes. Another of 15. There were two break points for Djokovic, nullified with the help of formidable serves. Federer took the game with three aces, three other clean winners and then broke to go up 2-0 on his way to 4-1.
Soon it was nearly 5-1 in Federer’s favor. Close doesn’t count, though.
Djokovic put up too much resistance, much like during their epic Wimbledon final last July, when he thwarted two championship points for Federer and wound up winning in a fifth-set tiebreaker.
This time, Djokovic said, “I managed to dig my way back.”
After Djokovic got out of that love-40 hole to hold, he trailed 5-2 and love-30.
But Djokovic picked up 10 consecutive points to not only hold there but also break at love in the following game as Federer, one of the most effective servers ever, served for the set. At love! Imagine that.
In the eventual tiebreaker, Djokovic did what Djokovic does: No mistakes and four pure winners, including a down-the-line backhand return to end it.
At the break, Federer took a medical timeout and went off court with a trainer, like he did against Sandgren. Djokovic stayed on the sideline while he, too, got checked out.
When play resumed, Federer did not look as spry or confident as in the first set. He tried shortcuts such as pushing forward on returns or less-than-ideal drop shots. He couldn’t generate so much as one break chance.
Djokovic took the set with a final-game break and the last two points were spectacular.
First, he followed up a stinging return by heading far to his left for a sprinting, sliding, stretching cross-court backhand passing shot; he probably shouldn’t even have put his racket on the ball, let alone managed to win the point.
Then he reacted to a short shot by Federer by running all-out to flip a cross-court forehand pass that made it two sets to none. Djokovic threw an uppercut and bellowed, “Come on!”
They played for another half-hour or so but all that was left to decide was the score, not who would win.
“He was better on the day today,” Federer said, “no question.”

China virus triggers global rush for protective masks
Joyce Lee, Lusha Zhang, January 31, 2020
SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - From South Korea to the Czech Republic, China’s coronavirus outbreak has triggered a massive surge in demand for protective masks, with factories scrambling to fill orders and shops selling out.
The virus, which first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed 170 people and infected more than 8,000. It spreads through droplets from coughs and sneezes.
Fears of infection have sent people rushing to pharmacies. In Hong Kong’s Kowloon district, anxious residents queued for seven hours on Thursday only to discover stores had sold out of masks.
Manufacturers have had to ramp up production, with some running factories 24 hours a day.
“We are considering increasing shifts to two, three in order to meet demand but capacity is limited, there’s only so much we can do,” said an official at Kukje Pharma Co , a South Korean mask manufacturer.
The company has received a rush of orders for “tens of millions of masks” since Jan. 24, he said.
In China, many factories are reopening from their Lunar New Year break and calling back workers from their holidays.
CMmask, a Chinese mask maker that supplies 30% of the domestic market , is receiving daily orders for 5 million masks, more than 10 times its usual level.
Hu Qinghui, CMmask’s deputy general manager, said its stockpile of more than 10 million masks was exhausted last week. It has resumed production and called back more than 130 workers with offers to triple their wages.
“The whole thing is so unexpected. We actually had a tough year in 2019 due to soft demand as air quality is getting better across the country,” Hu said.
However, just 40% of China’s mask factories, which supply half of global demand, have resumed production , an industry ministry official told the state-run People’s Daily newspaper.
As the global shortage worsened, Pardam, a Czech Republic mask manufacturer, has seen orders from Asia and Europe increase sharply.
 “We are absolutely sold out,” said R&D specialist Jana Ruzickova. “Now we are trying our best to increase our production.”
 “Demand ... increased in the last four days by 57,000%. This number cannot be accommodated, even by any well-established firm in the world,” said Pavel Malus from the Czech Nanotechnology Association.
In Turkey, Erol Memis of Era Respiratory Masks near Istanbul said the company had been working round the clock since receiving its first order from China on Thursday.
Era had also received inquiries from Switzerland, France, Belgium, Georgia, Armenia and Egypt. “It is not possible for us to complete every request,” Memis said.
Amid heightened anxieties about the virus, retailers and authorities have sought to stop hoarding and price gouging.
Taiwan announced a one-month ban on the export of specialist masks, while Singapore’s largest supermarket chain NTUC Fairprice has limited customer purchases.
In China, a Beijing drugstore was fined 3 million yuan ($435,000) for hiking mask prices by almost six times.
Meanwhile, the spike in demand has provided a massive boost for shares of mask makers, with Japan’s Kawamoto Corp up nearly six-fold to a record high. In South Korea, Kukje and Monalisa Co Ltd rose 58% and 86%, respectively.
Anti-China sentiment spreads along with coronavirus
Stanley Widianto, Khanh VU, January 30, 2020
JAKARTA/HANOI (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.
The virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing’s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.
Authorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, were moved to warn against discrimination towards Chinese Canadians, while in Europe there was anecdotal evidence of Chinese residents facing prejudice in the street, and hostile newspaper headlines.
“Orientalist assumptions plus political distrust plus health concerns are a pretty powerful combination,” said Charlotte Setijadi, and anthropologist who teaches at Singapore Management University.
Chinese authorities have said the virus emerged from a market selling illegally traded wildlife, giving rise to widespread social media mocking of China’s demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine.
“Stop eating bats,” said one Twitter user in Thailand, the top destination for Chinese tourists. “Not surprising that the Chinese are making new diseases,” another Thai user posted alongside a video clip that showed a man eating raw meat.
“Because your country is beginning (to) spread disease...we do not accept to serve the guest from China,” read a sign in English outside the Danang Riverside hotel in the central Vietnamese city of the same name. Authorities later told the hotel to remove the sign, its manager said in a Facebook post.

“Understanding the Corona Virus Hoax”. 	"“Understanding the Corona Virus Hoax” by T. Matthew Phillips, Esq.
The Corona virus is man-made. It’s a laboratory invention. And it’s patented. Disturbing but true.
Close your eyes. Imagine a world where disease-carrying pathogens are considered “inventions.” Now open your eyes. You live in that world!
The U.S. Patent Office indicates that Corona virus is Patent No. US10130701B2 (Nov. 20, 2018). Click on the below link — and see for yourself — Corona Patent –> https://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701/en
Waves of Corona outbreaks are coming soon! But there’s good news — the Corona vaccine will soon be available at CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens! Just in the nick of time!
So, what’s a Corona virus? It’s a virus that reportedly causes runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever . According to WebMD: “In most cases, you won’t know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus.” In other words, it’s just the common cold.
But common cold outbreaks are not scary enough to prompt lawmakers to enact new vaccine mandates. So they crank-up the fear factor with horror movie headlines and apocalyptic images of sinister undertakers dressed in creepy-looking HAZ-MAT outfits!
And when the Corona virus strikes, gov’t authorities will refuse to examine it under a microscope. If they ever do, they’ll immediately recognize the patented LAB strain of the virus — in every confirmed case — and it will then be revealed that the LAB strain caused the outbreak!
Yes, folks are being infected with the LAB strain of the virus. But if this fact ever leaks-out, the Corona Caper will unravel. So the authorities LIE to us. They claim the outbreaks are caused by elusive, WILD strains of the virus. But remember, Corona virus is an “invention.” There is no WILD strain of the virus!
The mainstream media have already begun their Corona disinformation campaign. Gov’t lapdogs at USA Today report on what they call “bogus theories” that the Corona virus is patented. Um, okay, — but it * is * patented. Not a “theory!” It’s a “factoid” capable of verification at the U.S. Patent Office.
According to USA Today , the Corona patent is just a social media myth. But USA Today is a fake news peddler! They get paid to run “ads” alongside their news stories. And the more ad revenue they receive, the more fake their stories become. Fake News from USA Today –> https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/25/wuhan-coronavirus-bogus-conspiracy-theory-spreads-social-media/4569180002/ Despite the disinformation, the Corona virus is indeed patented — which makes it readily identifiable and distinct from WILD strains. The gov’t clearly has the means to discern whether victims are catching the LAB strain or a WILD strain, but the gov’t just doesn’t care to investigate. They already know which strain sparked the outbreak! After all, it was the gov’t that awarded the patent in the first place! (Wink-wink!)
When Corona outbreaks visit your town (and they will) tell your local health inspectors that Corona “test kits” yield only positive or negative test results, i.e ., they never reveal the actual viral strain.
When they announce Corona outbreaks, insist that officials examine blood samples under a microscope — to determine whether the outbreak involves the LAB strain or a WILD strain.
Hey! There’s a Quest Diagnostics lab on every street corner in America! There’s no reason to avoid scrutinizing the Corona virus under a microscope! But mainstream science has no wish to study, research, or gain understanding about the origins of infectious outbreaks or how they spread. Mainstream science is too busy creating fear and panic — to sell more vaccines.
Once you see the fraud in how they “confirm” the identity of the virus that supposedly caused the outbreak, you suddenly see the fraud in the outbreak itself. All outbreak hoaxes unravel once you realize that “confirmed” cases of the dreaded disease are never actually “confirmed” under a microscope.
Consider this — many scientists are employed as “virus hunters.” Their only job is to search for new viruses. If they find one — they quickly bring it into captivity — to patent it! Capitalism has a way of turning nature into commodities! And yet, whenever there’s an infectious outbreak, presumably caused by new, WILD viruses, nobody ever goes hunting for these new, WILD viruses! (Get it?)
Predictably, the unvaccinated will be blamed for the Corona outbreaks. Kristen Bell will blame the heathen parents of unclean, ungodly, and unvaccinated children who aren’t caught-up on their Corona boosters, right?! But wait a sec’— how can Sarah Marshall blame the unvaccinated for Corona outbreaks — when all Americans are unvaccinated for Coronal Disease? (“Shh!” Don’t ask!)
If they ever examined, under a microscope, blood samples from Corona victims, they’d plainly see that all were infected with the LAB strain of the virus! And they cleverly conceal this fact with test kits that test only for exposure to the virus — and which never identify the culprit viral strain! (Are you paying attention?)
Guess what? Ebola virus is patented. AIDS virus is patented. Measles virus is patented. And so is Chickenpox virus, Zika virus, SARS virus, MRSA virus, Avian flu virus, etc . Any virus you can name — it’s patented. All viruses now in captivity are patented.
And all Corona outbreaks are staged media events! For goodness’ sake — no Corona outbreaks exist in the historical record!
Remember when your mom told you how to care for diseases like Mumps, Measles and Coronas? Remember that time you stayed home from school for a week with a bad case of the Coronas? NO! Because the Corona virus never existed until Bill Gates paid some slob to invent it — so they can have more outbreaks — so they can sell more vaccines — so they can kill-off more useless eaters — so they can roll-out their new world order! “If we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, and reproductive health services, we could lower world population by 10 or 15 percent.”– Bill Gates
You guessed it! Bill Gates owns the patented Corona virus! And, not surprisingly, Bill Gates also own the rights to the anti-Corona virus vaccine!
The recent Corona outbreaks, which follow closely on the heels of the patent approval, is another c-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y . (There! I said it!) But this should be evident from the intensive media coverage, which is calculated to scare you half to death! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Fear sells vaccines!
Corona outbreaks will scare lawmakers into enacting Corona vaccine mandates! Next thing ya know, they will patent a Heineken virus! So expect Heineken outbreaks — and then Heineken vaccines! This is how they do the masses. This is how the vaccine holocaust begins! This is what genocide looks like!
This is how they plan to exterminate seven billion useless eaters. There’s no need for gas chambers when vaccines will do the job nice and neat — and nobody will even know it’s a holocaust.
The downward spiral comes quickly — the time to resist is now. Just remember, it’s easier to genocide a population — than to convince them they’re being genocided. You heard me."
Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV. 	The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model using deep learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that a number of FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Researchers race against the clock to to develop 2019-nCov vaccine. 	"Scientists released a series of over 34,000 letters that translated to the 2019-nCov’s molecular blueprint after the respiratory illness emerged in China. Now, researchers from around the globe immediately took hold of the letters to develop a vaccine that will control the rampant spread of the pathogen.
Now that the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency with 7,700 confirmed cases of the infection in more than a dozen countries, scientists are racing against the clock to crack the code.
Experts are hoping to create a vaccine that will be greenlighted for clinical trials in just months. This is an ambitious target for a tedious process that can take up to a decade to complete in some cases.
University of Washington’s virologist Alex Greninger spoke about the matter to The Guardian.“Basically, we’ve gotten a lot better at doing this,” he said.
He continued: “The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) already had a diagnostic test ready by the time the first patient that they tested came in. That’s amazing, and it’s really thanks to the sharing of that initial genome.”
A recent breakthrough is expected to further speed up the process of producing the vaccine. At Melbourne, Australia’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, scientists were able to create a lab-grown version of the 2019-nCov.
As of Wednesday, the official death toll caused by the novel coronavirus stands at 170. Confirmed cases have been reported from 14 countries outside of China as of this writing."
What happens if a corona virus gets a dog? This scientist has a plan. 	"We should not panic – but we should be prepared. Following the SARS crisis, researchers showed that domestic cats could catch acute respiratory syndrome and transmit it to other cats, as well as gulls. The cats who lived in a Hong Kong apartment block were found with an unusual number of SARS patients infected with the virus. Dogs associated with Ebola infected health care workers were destroyed or quarantined in Spain and the United States because officials were concerned about transmissible.
And the novel coronavirus, “We have no idea if there is any danger, but we have to assume that there is some until we prove the contrary,” said Weese to the Star last week after talking about animals and on infectious diseases by Ontario Veterinary Medical Association conference in Toronto. “If we are saying that your husband must quarantine, we should do the same with your dog and cat.”
It would be preferable that we now see a few animals inside and find out later that these measures were not unnecessary and did not cause them any disruption and that they later got a role in their transmission.
“That said, it is more difficult to quench a dog then, in certain ways,” he says. Dogs must bounce, and UberEats cats can not be ordered.
If a coronary virus patient could no longer care for their pets, it will certainly come here, to Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Center, Canada’s largest animal hospital and a facility equipped with high-level isolated units.
Scott Weese, an infectious animal disease researcher, and Marlowe Schott, an infection control practitioner, wear protective equipment as he goes through a practice process to admit a dog to the integrated animal hospital facilities at the University of Guelph on Friday. Peter Power / Don Toronto Star
Weese researchers’ attention arises from urgent truth: when it comes to infectious diseases, the barrier between people and all other animals is very permeable.
Bats are likely to have originated in Chinese horseshoe bats and jumped to palm civets, a wild mammal being sold at a live animal market in Guangdong province of China, before entering the market. The best blow to researchers at present is the novel source of coronary viruses than bats, and then it is likely that there will be an intermediary mammal before making the jump to humans. On Friday, Chinese researchers published preliminary findings – many scientists were not in dispute – suggesting that the animal is a coronavirus of the pangolin, a protected mammal that is illegally trafficked nevertheless.
Over 70 per cent of new infectious diseases come from animals, according to estimates. Ebola, anthrax, swine flu, avian influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome have an animal base.
But the transmission can go away – which is also a problem for people. If we have an infectious disease but continue to spread in animals, these animals act as a “reservoir” for disease and risk that triggers a new outbreak. Pets can also be an infectious risk because we are in contact with them a lot: it is difficult to disinfect fur.
During the SARS crisis in 2003, over 8,000 people around the world and killed nearly 800, including 44 in Canada, made Weese try to flag pets as a concern. He discovered a significant microbiologist during the crisis and raised the possibility of transmitting human-by-animals.
“The kind of response was,‘ Yeah, it’s interesting, go. ”You are in the middle of a big chaos, and this is an issue – dealing with all the human things is a priority.”
Public health officers rely on “contact tracking” when attempting to limit the spread of infectious diseases: identify and follow up anyone who may come into contact with an ill person. In Toronto in 2003, over 23,000 people were quarantined for contact with a SARS or suspected case.
“Traditionally this means human contacts,” says Weese. “In me, contacts mean anything that has a pulse.”
The Irish people knew that the spread of SARS could be catastrophic if the virus got into the Toronto population of stray cats.
SARS revealed dangerous gaps in Toronto’s healthcare system, some of which were above: hospital infection prevention and control teams contributed to staff, local public health agencies expanded, and rapid communication systems were developed.
For human health, “the response to this was much better than SARS because all preparedness was there. The response on the side of the animal is not as nice as I would like it to be, ”but it is better, thanks in part to the work done following the high profile Ebola scare.
Scott Weese, right director of the Center for Public Health and Zoonoses at the University of Guelph, and Marlowe Schott, an infection control practitioner, are looking at ways in which a pet with the coronary virus can infect people. The quota points out that there are no concerns that cats and dogs will spread the virus in Ontario. Peter Power / Don Toronto Star
Nothing aggravating the mind as a hemorrhagic fever outbreak is very contagious: For a few months late in 2014, the public was suddenly and deeply invested in whether pets could catch infectious diseases.
The terrible Ebola outbreak grew in West Africa, which would eventually kill more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In October of that year, Spanish nurse Ebola seized a patient from the region.
Despite objections, the Spanish health authorities destroyed the nurse’s dog, fearing that they would be transmitted. The evidence to support these fears is limited: one study found that dogs living near an outbreak site had Ebola antibodies, suggesting that there was some infection.
Later that same month, a Texas nurse was diagnosed with Ebola. Her dog, Bentley, was quarantined, getting support for the dog – president Barack Obama inquired about Bentley after the nurse was released from hospital.
Subsequently, Weese and a number of co-authors developed a comprehensive guidance document on what would happen in Ontario if a dog were exposed to Ebola.
With Merlin acting as the exposed animal, Weese and a colleague, including Merlin, had a thorough long-time simulation taking place, to recover, transport and isolate, to discourage all potential incidents. (For cats, they wore Kevlar gloves scratch resistant.) They covered themselves in a pouch of pads and chocolate sauce before their protective equipment was destroyed: their bodies or clothes were stained after disinfecting evidence of corruption. “Ebola”.
“When we wrote the Ebola (guidelines), we realized that they probably wouldn’t use it, but we might use it for something else,” said Weese. The current coronavirus outbreak is the type of sample.
The tooths emphasize again and again that there is no concern that cats and dogs will spread corona virus in Ontario. As he recently wrote on his blog “Worms and Germs”, “It can be a battle asking people to think about animal issues without going over the top, because the line between awareness and paranoia is quite short. ”
He wants us to reflect on our understanding of animals, not only in the field of disease, but more widely.
It is not a population of dogs, cats, pigs and pangolins: we are also animals at one planet with all the others.

Harvard Jew Behind the Corona Virus Contagion?. 	"On January 28, 2020, Lieber [Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor] was arrested on charges of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Defense and to Harvard investigators regarding his participation in China's Thousand Talents Program. The program was created to bribe American scientists and researchers to provide their research to China. In addition, his house was raided by the FBI. Wouldn't surprise me if Lieber was up to no good, as a Jew --Dr. Zack--was behind the post-9.11 Anthrax attacks. Dr. Zack was treated with kid gloves while Dr. Hatfill was hounded relentlessly, an attack aided by the (((MSM))) . The FBI, finally realizing they had fucked up--AGAIN--dropped the investigation,which allowed Hatfill to sue their sorry asses.
Dr. Zack left Fort Detrick in December 1991 amid allegations of unprofessional conduct. The Jewish scientist and others were accused of harassing their co-worker, Dr. Ayaad Assaad, until the Egyptian-born American scientist quit, according to an article in Connecticut’s The Hartford Courant, the country’s oldest newspaper in continuous publication. Dr. Assaad sued the Army, claiming discrimination after Zack’s badgering.
Although Dr. Zack was let go, he returned frequently to visit friends, and used the Fort Detrick laboratories for “off-the-books” work after hours. After reports of missing biological specimens—including anthrax, Ebola and the simian AIDs virus—came to light, as well as reports of unauthorized research, a review of surveillance camera tapes recorded Dr. Zack entering the lab late on the night of Jan. 23, 1992, according to The Hartford Courant report. He was let in that night by Marian Rippy, a lab pathologist and close friend of Zack’s, although she now says she has no memory of the evening. She did say that Zack occasionally visited and that other friends let him in. A Jew badgering an Arab? Say it ain't so!
Oh BTW, Zack is a Zionist.
FBI Closes in on Anthrax Terrorist
Prime Suspect is a Zionist by Hector Carreon
La Voz de Aztlan
Los Angeles, Alta California - 2/26/2002 - (ACN) Jewish microbiologist Dr. Philip M. Zack may be behind the deadly anthrax contaminated letters that were mailed to NBC's Tom Brokaw, Senator Tom Daschle and others, according to FBI sources. In a rapidly unravelling investigation by the FBI, it appears that the ""Arab-hating-Jew"" was behind a vile conspiracy to frame a colleague who was born in Egypt and who worked, along with Dr. Zack , at the U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Md. ""Death to America and Death to Israel?"" Did they also leave behind their passport? Go to Lieber's web site, ""Lieber Research Group"" and you'll find he's in bed with some very strange and dangerous people...
Try as I might, couldn't find specific info on Lieber's heritage, but Harvard is one of the Jewiest university's in the USA. 55% of the graduates are Juden.
And Lieber is a certified Jew surname. Plus, the president of Harvard's mother is an Awwshitz graduate. So many survivors, just who in the hell did those nasty Nazis kill?
Harvard department chair, BU researcher charged with concealing ties to China
Federal authorities on Tuesday discussed three cases in which researchers affiliated with Boston-area institutions are accused of trying to provide clandestine scientific aid to the People's Republic of China.
""This is a small sample of China's ongoing campaign to siphon off American technology and know-how for Chinese gain,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said during a press conference at the Moakley Federal Courthouse. The chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard University, Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, is accused of lying to federal authorities about his ties to China and was arrested Tuesday, officials announced.
""China's Thousand Talents Plan, according to the complaint (is) a Chinese government-run program designed to entice scientists and researchers in the United States to share their research expertise with China,"" said Lelling. ""China's ongoing campaign to siphon off American technology..?"" The dummies should of gotten an Israeli front man/woman. If they had, this story would of never came to light.
Why lie about consulting with China? Unless there's much more to this story.
On the other hand, maybe it's just a simple case of that Jew superiority thing, where they're always lording it over us GOYIM about how smart they are, so when some farm animal Goyim dare to ask His Highness some questions, it's the Jews right to lie.
After all, we're just dumbass animals here to serve the Jews, as many a Rabbi will tell you.
What makes this worse, most of the troublesome 'Jews' in STOLENLAND aren't even Jews, their impostors. The Palestinians are the rightful owners of that land.

Chinese scientists trying to find cause of Chinese Corona Virus. 	"Chinese scientists trying to find cause of Chinese Corona Virus Chinese scientists trying to find cause of Chinese Corona Virus Alex Rose-Innes
The new strain of the Corona virus responsible for 300 Chinese infections and six deaths since December last year, is presenting scientists with a new challenge to identifying it. According to the The World Health Organisation (WHO) most cases were reported in Beijing, Shenzen and Wuhan. The virus had now also reared its head in Thailand, Japan and the United States of America (USA).
While most transmissions could be from animals, the virus is also transmittable from human to human. The first cases were reported after a fish market was identified as the source of the first reported cases.
The new strain is thought to be related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ),a viral respiratory disease responsible for pneumonia. There is currently no vaccine available to prevent transmission. Limit contact with farm and wild animals (also in zoo’s). Avoid eating sushi Meat and eggs should be cooked very well."

Thoughts on Corona Virus during the year of the rats. 	"There were heavy traffic from freeway for miles coming home from my open house. I thought there was auto accident and thought nothing of it until I saw the event at a new Vietnamese Buddhist Temple. Oh, this is the Chinese celebration of year of rats. Last night I thought I heard gun shots fired at mid night. Check through a neighborhood website that people lite fire crackers in celebration of a Chinese New Year.
So what is new? I read through an Indian newspaper that the Central China snake virus that broke out all from a wild life meat market. You can buy camel meat, baby wolf cubs, snakes, rats, raccon, live foxes, monkey, scorpian, civet(cat like animals) as well as dogs etc. for food consumption . Their meat possess warm energy to invigorate folks blood circulation in the winter. That is a 2000 year old recipe.
A few days ago I blogged about how the viruses spread and had to update the fatalities stats at least once a day . This morning as the viruses spread it added 15 more death in China. People infected can result in a death fatality hours if not days. Most of infected death were market workers and hospital staff. In Taiwan, a patient walked in for fever treatment has been identified as positive and he was in contact with 6 hospital workers now the people in contact are being isolated for observation. How did he get through the airport? Well, he took aspirins and was not detected by the thermometer.
As of this morning 1/26/2020 there were 56 deaths and 2,082 confirmed tested as positive patients. This is 2.7% of death rate. China started the construction of second field hospital that will house 1,300 patients in a shorter time from ground up in 14 days. It seems to have gone out of hand as Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneylands are closed. In Shanghai they just reported first case of break out.
As the mutant virus develop more ability to affect human, Canada just declared 1st case. US has two known cases so we know this virus is spreading fast.
I have surgical masks, thermometers ready and cancelled all travelling plans. I use hand disinfactant wipe as often as needed. People are selling Disney(DIS) stocks expecting a so so market if not depressed week at Wall Street.
Welcome to the year of rats."
Schools opening moved to September in some areas due to COVID-19 risk. 	"The Department of Education will present its recommendation on the opening of the next school year to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases on the first week of May.
The STAR quoted Education Secretary Leonor Briones as saying this, after presidential spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said that President Rodrigo Duterte approved IATF’s recommendations, which include moving the next schools opening in some areas to September. Related Stories Metro Manila, Calabarzon among areas to remain in enhanced quarantine until May 15
Roque said in an interview with radio dzBB Friday morning that Duterte “adopted in full” the IATF’s recommendation that includes moving schools opening in areas under General Community Quarantine to September.
Acting NEDA general Karl Chua also clarified that Roque only presented recommendations for consideration after they conducted a health study. But the Education department will still present to the task force on the matter. IATF recommendation
Roque, in a taped address aired earlier, said the IATF recommended “100% closure” for areas deemed as “moderate to low-risk,” or the localities placed under GCQ.
READ: General community quarantine to be implemented in moderate, low-risk areas
“Iyong option po sa low-risk to moderate areas na buksan by industry, consider for 100 percent closure maski po low to moderate risk consider for 100 percent closure pa rin dahil po ang mga transmitters ay kabataan mula edad 0 to 20. Lahat ng eskwelahan, i-consider po ang late opening sa Setyembre except po sa online learning,” he said.
(The option for low-risk to moderate areas to open by industry, consider for 100 percent closure, even low to moderate risk, consider for 100 percent closure still. Because the transmitters are the youth ages 0 to 20, all schools, consider late opening in September except in online learning.)
The higher education institutions in these localities “may continue to finish academic year and issue credential to students,” Roque said.
It is unclear whether schools in localities still under and recently placed in Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) are included in this recommendation.
Republic Act 7977 or the act on lengthening of school calendar states that opening of classes should be made between the first week of June and the last day of August.
Briones earlier said the department is conducting nationwide consultations, including business partners and education experts, on when the next school year will start. Trends point to an opening on August 4.
But Briones said the IATF assessment will affect DepEd’s moves as the country continues to apply stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Education Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan previously said in a radio interview that the department is eyeing to utilize information communication technology platforms for learners. This can be done through television and radio.
The Education secretary also said they are looking into “alternative delivery modes” that do not require face to face interactions among students and teachers. — Kristine Joy Patag As It Happens LATEST UPDATE: April 24, 2020 - 8:46am

World leaders launch plan to speed COVID-19 drugs, vaccine; U.S. stays away. 	"World leaders pledged on Friday to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a video conference to launch what the WHO billed as a ""landmark collaboration"" to fight the pandemic.
The aim is to speed development of safe and effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the lung disease caused be the novel coronavirus - and ensure equal access to treatments for rich and poor.
""We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he opened the virtual meeting.
""Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.""
During the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.
""We must make sure that people who need them get them,"" said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. ""The lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.
""This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,"" von der Leyen told the conference.
""COMMON FIGHT""
Leaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.
A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.
""Although the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,"" he said by email.
""We remain deeply concerned about the WHO's effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,"" he later said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being ""China-centric"" and announced a suspension of funding.
Tedros has steadfastly defended the WHO's handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.
Macron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.
Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: ""And I hope we'll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying 'the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle'.""
Merkel said: ""This concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.""
Ramaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was ""extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support"".
VACCINE TRIALS
More than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.
""As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,"" said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO's second largest donor last year.
More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.
""We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritise vaccine candidates,"" he told a Geneva news briefing.
Yuan Qiong, senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Access Campaign welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps. ""There shouldn't be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this pandemic,"" she told Reuters."

"Chinese woman eating an entire bat at a fancy eating place has long past viral as China and different countries inside the international are trying to comprise the unfold of the Wuhan virus codenamed 2019-nCoV. The Wuhan virus belongs to a circle of relatives of coronavirus with many scientists believed that it would have originated from bats, the most effective mammals able to fly.

OU Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation File for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19 Detection Test Utilizing Fluidigm Technology. 	"Fluidigm Corporation ( NASDAQ:FLDM ), an innovative biotechnology tools provider with a vision to improve life through comprehensive health insight, today announced that OU Medicine, the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) intend to utilize Fluidigm ® microfluidics technology and certain reagents to test individuals for the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The spread of this disease has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
The test, developed by OMRF and OU Health Sciences Center scientists and utilizing Fluidigm products, is intended for large-scale testing of patients across the OU Medicine health care system. OU Medicine has applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the test from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with FLDM. Click here to check it out. FLDM 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of FLDM Peter Lynch Chart of FLDM “Solutions that offer scale and high-speed processing are critically important in ramping up testing capabilities for COVID-19,” said OMRF President Stephen Prescott, MD. “We anticipate that the test will generate several thousand test results per day, and it comes online at a particularly critical time for COVID-19 patients in Oklahoma.”
High-complexity labs certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments in the United States are eligible under new FDA guidance to create their own diagnostic test kits for COVID-19. OU Medicine, the University of Oklahoma and OMRF are among academic and government organizations utilizing Fluidigm microfluidics technology and reagents in COVID ‑ 19 testing. The institutions validated a workflow designed to be run on the Fluidigm Biomark™ HD system.
“We are grateful for the collaboration and leadership of the researchers at OU Health Sciences Center and OMRF. This partnership with three Oklahoma health care leaders and Fluidigm makes it possible for OU Medicine to offer this unique testing capability to our state,” said Chuck Spicer, FACHE, President and CEO of OU Medicine, Inc. “We believe this greatly increased number of tests will serve as a turning point in our battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“Readily accessible and rapid testing for COVID-19 not only expedites treatment for patients who test positive, but it allows health care providers to be routinely tested to ensure their safety and that of everyone they encounter. Increased testing will also allow more patients without COVID-19 to access specialty care at OU Medicine, including surgeries, procedures and other diagnostic testing,” Spicer said.
“The remarkable volume of testing made available through the tireless work of our OU Health Sciences Center researchers and partners at OU Medicine, OMRF and Fluidigm is, simply put, game-changing,” said OU Interim President Joseph Harroz, Jr. “As this innovative testing platform ramps into full capacity, we will be able to ensure Oklahoma has consistent testing for the current environment and for possible future outbreaks, as well as demographic and geographic sampling that can help contain further spread.”
Microfluidics technology generates more data and uses a fraction of expensive testing reagents per sample as compared with more traditional, microwell plate-based PCR technology. Fluidigm Biomark HD and the company’s microfluidics technology, in particular, enable automated high-throughput assembly of PCRs at the nanoscale level.
“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, adequate resources for testing have been a serious challenge for health care systems around the world,” said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO of Fluidigm. “Speed, scale and automation are critical components for delivering timely results. The Biomark HD platform can generate more than 6,000 individual test results per day with just one hour of hands-on time. A single system supports more than 2 million annual tests, and we are partnering with labs around the world to build out critically needed testing infrastructure.”
“We are excited to support OU Medicine, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in this incredibly important program. In parallel with this scaling of testing capacity, Fluidigm products are providing vital information on immune response to COVID-19 exposure. This information is essential for evaluation of patient management approaches and effective development of vaccines and therapeutic candidates. The COVID-19 testing program for Oklahoma City positions that community at the forefront of pandemic preparation efforts in the global fight against this virus.”
In a separate program, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a group of other U.S. medical schools are developing a new epigenetic test for early COVID-19 detection designed for the Biomark HD, with the intent to seek EUA from the FDA.

People seem to think Corona beer is related to the deadly Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, as searches for ‚Corona beer virus‘ are trending. 	A robot named Little Peanut is delivering food to people in quarantine amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak „Hello everyone. Cute Little Peanut is serving food to you now,“ the robot said according to a translation. „Enjoy your meal.“ 
Fears thick 'death' smog over Wuhan confirms China is burning corona bodies. 	"Eerie footage of Wuhan engulfed in a thick fog has fuelled concerns the death toll inside coronavirus -hit China is “higher” than what’s been officially reported. Clips appear to show the city in a mysterious haze which residents say has “come out of nowhere”. The videos have led to concerns that the smog is the result of smoke from crematoriums burning coronavirus-infected bodies ""24 hours a day"". It comes a day after the National Health Commission in China ordered all coronavirus fatalities to be cremated, with burials and funerals banned, to prevent to spread of disease. Chinese nationals voiced their concerns on social media, suggesting the death toll could be ""unthinkably higher"" than reports if incinerators are running all day. The strange videos have sparked concerns the fog is actually smoke"
Testing COVID-19 Samples, Step by Step, Inside the Hartford HealthCare Lab. 	"Testing COVID-19 Samples, Step by Step, Inside the Hartford HealthCare Lab April 23, 2020
In hospitals, nursing homes and facilities across Connecticut, thousands of Hartford Healthcare workers are working tirelessly to combat COVID-19. Not far from Hartford Hospital , another team is quietly carrying out a critical task that supports their colleagues on the frontlines.
At the Hartford HealthCare laboratory , the microbiology team is performing COVID-19 testing for Hartford HealthCare patients and employees. The lab provides microbiology testing for five of seven hospitals within the Hartford HealthCare system.
With a capacity to complete nearly 200 tests a day, the lab is in operation 24 hours a day to process the specimens. The lab is turning around results in 24 to 36 hours.
A specimen’s journey starts at one of the Hartford HealthCare drive-up testing sites. An oropharyngeal (oral) or nasopharyngeal (nasal) sample is collected, then transported to the lab receiving area. From there, it is sent to the Hartford HealthCare Microbiology Laboratory in Newington for testing.
At the lab, the specimen is heat-inactivated to ensure the virus is no longer infectious, protecting the laboratory technologists performing the procedure, or assay. The specimen is then placed onto an automated extraction instrument and loaded onto a dual amplification and detection instrument.
Creating, or validating, an assay is something that the lab team had been preparing for in advance of the Coronavirus arrival in Connecticut. Giuseppe Mignosa, Regional Director of Laboratory Services, says the staff understood the urgency: “The m2000 is the molecular instrument we are using for the testing. As soon as the FDA cleared the m2000 assay for testing, we put it into action.”
Mignosa says the skill and expertise of the team demonstrated during this crisis exemplifies what they are trained to do.
“This could be the biggest moment in our lab’s history,” he said. “It typically takes a year to develop a test. We have been ready for this. We are here to support patient care.”
In and out of the lab, the collaboration of several teams is on display.
“The phlebotomy team continues the important work as the front-end patient facing lab staff,” said Mignosa. “Everyone is stepping up to the plate – coming to work every day, interacting with patients. All lab staff is performing other necessary blood testing for all inpatients in house. COVID-19 notwithstanding, we serve as the central lab of Hartford HealthCare.”
For Mignosa, it comes down to a simple mission they’ve had all along.
“I couldn’t be more proud of this team – everybody working toward the same goal of supporting patient care,” he said. “Our team has worked tirelessly, putting in extra hours, focused on this virus and providing the test results as efficiently as possible. This is why we do what we do.”"
The best Side of corona-virus. 	" Some conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers and option information media have alleged that the coronavirus was stolen from a Canadian virus exploration lab by Chinese scientists, citing a news short article by Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) in July 2019.[420] CBC claimed their early report was distorted by misinformation, and the conspiracy idea had 'no factual foundation'.China Customs started necessitating that each one travellers entering and exiting China fill out an additional health and fitness declaration type from 26 January. The health declaration sort was mentioned in China's Frontier Well being and Quarantine Legislation, granting the customs rights to have to have it if needed. The customs reported it will ""restart this system"" because it was not a prerequisite right before.[247][248][249]Wuhan's givernment explained it programs to convert a few current venues, like a gymnasium and an exhibition centre, into hospitals to absorb individuals with mild indications of the new coronavirusFor those who have returned from any afflicted area in China and have developed a sore throat, substantial temperature, runny nose or problem in respiration, don’t move outdoors your private home until finally authorized by a healthcare provider.The full planet is with a higher notify next experiences of the outbreak of Coronavirus disease in China.The outbreak itself is a concern with the 2020 Summertime Olympics which can be scheduled to take place in Tokyo commencing at the end of July; mainly because of the Olympics, the national government has become using excess safety measures to aid limit the outbreak's worst effects.Silicon Valley representatives expressed concerns about critical disruption to generation strains, as much from the engineering sector relies on factories in Mainland China.Ensure that the patient acquire good care and eats the right sort of food stuff which will Improve immunity and prevent the infection from getting even worse.By late January, 17 Chinese cities, dwelling to a lot more than fifty million men and women, are in lockdown.

White House Asks Scientists To Investigate Whether 2019-nCoV Was Bio-Engineered. 	"A week ago, we published details that raised questions about the source of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, specifically questioning the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market as a fabricated farce.
The real reason behind the viral spread, we suggested, was that a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada ) , was released by Wuhan's Institute of Virology (presumably accidentally ) , China's only top, level-4 biohazard lab, which was studying "" the world's most dangerous pathogens .""
At the time we summarized the series of dots and asked ""real reporters"" to connect them: One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp . Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world. His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ( such as the STING pathway in bats ) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Of course, that is all ancient history and Zero Hedge was permanently banned from Twitter for raising such a conspiracy theory about a publicly-searchable person working a publicly-searchable place.
But, bygones being bygones, we moved on... until today when no lesser entity than The White House began asking questions about the origin of the deadly coronavirus.
As ABC News reports, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts ""rapidly"" look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and ""to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.""
Specifically, ABC News' Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about concerns that stem from misinformation online that the novel coronavirus could have been engineered or deliberately released .
""There's always that concern ,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said.
""And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there's even any possibility much less likelihood that that's going on . And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.""
The White House has good reason to question the official story as evolutionary biologist Dr. James Lyons-Weiler of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge , showed and explained how the coronavirus' genetic sequence - which has been publicly released by China - contains a unique ""middle fragment"" encoding a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spike protein that appears, according to his genomic analysis, to have been inserted into the 2019-nCoV virus using ""pShuttle"" technology. This technique can only be done in a lab, as it has never occurred naturally in nature.
“This isn't a 'conspiracy theory', it is a scientific, medical theory,” says Del Bigtree, the Emmy-winning producer and founder of non-profit Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).
“Its foundation is based on sound science, logic, and research, and the mainstream media needs to be asked whether it is going to pursue this link to SARS instead of trying to censor anyone who is trying to pursue truth via scientific fact .”
One additional, major reason we suspect this line of logical reasoning could be correct - as conspiratorial as it may seem - is that Chinese authorities have launched a full-scale crusade to disprove the fact that this deadly virus was man-made.
""Conspiracy theorists don't believe in science. I hope that the national professional department will investigate and give us an innocence,"" Shi Zhengli, a director at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China - responded to Caixin on February 4.
Faced with external doubts and accusations, on February 2nd, Shi Zhengli responded angrily in the WeChat circle of friends:
"" The new coronavirus in 2019 is a punishment for uncivilized living habits of human beings by nature . It doesn't matter. I advise those who believe and spread rumours of bad media, believe in the so-called academic analysis that Indian scholars do not rely on, and close your mouth. ""
Additionally, as The Washington Times reports, one ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is the that false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.
That could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhan’s civilian or defense research laboratories .
As a reminder, it was discovered that Shi Zhengli had participated in a study published in Natural Medicine on November 9, 2015, about a disease that can be caused by a SARS-like coronavirus (SHC014-CoV) found in Chinese horseshoe bats .
The researchers used the SARS reverse genetics system to generate and identify a chimeric virus. In simple terms, this chimeric virus consists of the surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of the SARS virus. The chimeric virus can infect human respiratory cells, demonstrating that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to key receptors on cells and infect cells. Chimeras can cause disease in mice, but they are not lethal. Studies have shown that viruses currently circulating in bat populations could potentially trigger the potential risk of SARS-CoV (SARS virus) outbreaks .
We are sure this is all just a coincidence - Wuhan epicenter... Only P4 facility in China... A lab investigating bats infected with genetically engineered Coronavirus... Coronavirus infected Bats... Chimeric bio-engineered viruses.... and that is probably why The White House is now asking authorities to investigate the source of the disease.
Of course, when Zero Hedge suggested the same thing, highlighting key personnel in the Wuhan lab that were publicly acknowledged as responsible for that research, we were immediately banned by Twitter. We look forward to reading Buzzfeed's article decrying The White House for daring to ask questions about the origin of this deadly pandemic."
COVID-19 crisis: Dearness Allowance for Central government employees frozen July 2021. 	" In view of the crisis arising out of COVID-19, government on Thursday decided to freeze payment of additional installment of Dearness Allowance (DA) to the Central government employees and dearness relief (DR) to pensioners falling due from January 1, 2020.
The decision comes after the Union Cabinet on March 14 approved a four per cent hike in DA to 21 per cent in a bonanza for 1.13 crore Central applicable from January, 2020 costing the exchequer Rs 14,595 crore.
In an office memorandum, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance said that additional installment of Dearness Allowance and DR falling due from July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will also not be paid. However, the allowance will continue to be paid at current rates.
The Central government employees will also not get any arrears in any future revision of DA/DR from July 1, 2021. However, If a decision to revise DA rates is taken for July 1, 2021 period, the rate of allowance as effective from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rates effective from July 1, 2021, the office memorandum said.
Though the government did not give an estimate of how much it would save by disallowing DA revision for its employees, a four per cent raise approved by cabinet last month meant additional expenditure of around Rs 15,000 crore. For three half yearly periods, going by this yardstick, would result in savings of close to Rs 45,000 for the Centre.
Any change in DA rates benefits about 48 lakh Central government employees and 65 lakh pensioners.
DA is paid by the government to its employees as well as pensioners to offset the impact of inflation. (IANS)"
COVID-19 is paving the way for an increase in superbugs. 	"The heroic efforts of researchers and healthcare professionals globally will eventually help us gain control of the coronavirus pandemic and there will be a decrease in the rate of new infections. The focus is still rightly on the damage this pandemic is causing, the devastating loss of life and the impact on businesses and livelihoods. But we also need to look at other prevalent crises that are affecting our healthcare systems and anticipate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on them.
One of the greatest threats to healthcare systems, around the world, is antibiotic resistance. The lack of effective antibiotics and the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to the drugs we have has resulted in the antibiotic resistance crisis.
More than 90% of people will be prescribed an antibiotic at some point in their lives. But prescribing antibiotics is a finite process. We do not have an endless supply of antibiotics to replace those that are no longer effective, and hardly any new antibiotics are being developed. In the meantime, bacteria have become resistant to more of the antibiotics in routine use and even to antibiotics of last resort (drugs with severe side-effects that are only used when all other antibiotics have failed).
We have now reached a point where infections are being seen in hospitals around the world that are resistant to all known antibiotics.
Secondary infections
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to huge numbers of people with compromised immune systems being admitted to hospitals, which are a known breeding ground for drug-resistant bacteria. Because of this influx, these hospital-associated bacteria will now have a much wider potential target group.
Emerging evidence suggests that high numbers of COVID-19 patients are being diagnosed with secondary infections while in hospital. The source and specific nature of these infections are yet to be fully explored, but there is some evidence that multidrug-resistant bacteria are among the germs causing these secondary infections.
These secondary infections appear to be having an impact on patient survival, with data from Wuhan showing that half of all COVID-19 patients who died had a secondary infection. That is because many of these hospital-associated bacteria are specifically adapted to establish infection in people with a weakened immune system.
History suggests that the mortality rate of viral pandemics is heavily influenced by secondary bacterial infections with large numbers of people in the 1918 and the 2009 flu pandemics succumbing to secondary bacterial infections rather than the virus itself.
The other factor that will have a significant impact on the antibiotic resistance crisis is the widespread use of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients.
Emerging data suggests that more than 90% of COVID-19 patients are also receiving antibacterial treatment. This rapid increase in antibiotic use, particularly in hospitals, will apply a strong selective pressure on bacteria to evolve resistance. This will probably contribute to an increase in the incidence of drug-resistant infections in the months and years after the pandemic is over.
A report published in 2016 suggested that by 2050, 10 million people a year could die from antibiotic-resistant infections. Given this prediction did not account for the devastating impact of COVID-19, this timeline will almost certainly have to be revised.
However, concerted efforts are being made to better understand antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients. The US Department of Defense has just launched a study to track antibiotic usage and the rate of secondary infections among COVID-19 patients. The results of studies such as this will help guide doctors on when and how to prescribe antibiotics for COVID-19 patients.
New drugs
According to the World Health Organization, 252 antibiotic drugs are in preclinical development - that is, they are currently being tested on animals. Unfortunately, only between two and five of these drugs will make it to market over the next decade.
One of the biggest hurdles in bringing these drugs to market is the prohibitive costs, which can be up to US$1 billion per drug (£816 million). This makes it difficult to recover investment and places a huge financial burden on the companies developing these drugs, many of which collapse under the strain. By addressing this financial burden and making the development of new antibiotics a global research priority, similar to what is being seen in the efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, we can ensure more of the antibiotics being developed make it to market.
Hopefully the response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be used as a blueprint in global cooperation to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis, a threat that has the potential to cripple our healthcare systems and medicine as we know it.

Voyages of Light: Corona Virus. 	"What's going on with this Corona Virus? I hear that there's a patent out for it which was approved in 2018. Now there's an epidemic in China, which of course is going to spread to all other parts of the world because every big city has a Chinatown. Same thing happened with SARS. This virus isn't even animal to human; it's human to human so they've eliminated the middle man, so to speak. We interact more with each other than we do with animals. How bad is this going to be? Ashtar: Not as bad as you think, Sharon. The news reports are spreading news of this epidemic in China all over the world. How often do you hear what happens in China? Me: Last I knew of was when the Olympics were held there. Ashtar: Exactly. You don't hear about what's happening in China unless the Deep State wants you to hear about it. The media takeover is one of first priorities because they are primarily responsible for spreading fear and panic around your world. Me: Well, it is mind control. Imagine a world with no newspapers, magazines or TV news? Ashtar: Not none of these, Sharon, we're saying a takeover is necessary. To spread the REAL news and not incur mass pandemonium. Your news is fake. Most of it is just blatant lying, and the focus on insipid subjects such as the lives of movie actors is downright ridiculous and an insult to the viewer. Me: What would the real news encompass? Ashtar: The truth that the Corona Virus, for example, is being spread as a means of wiping out humanity on your earth. Me: Like that wouldn't spread panic? Ashtar: You need to know the truth, Sharon. Ultimately your truth will be more bearable than the truth of pandemics being deliberately spread. They would also spread solutions in dealing with these pandemics. Me: Okay. Ashtar: Your postulation that the reason they're causing pandemics instead of warring between countries is correct. They're not allowed to use nuclear devices because they will then incur immediate consequences from our Light forces for doing so. We have most of their weaponry disarmed so they aren't usable. But I say most, not all. Those that have already fired upon others on your planet, nuclear or not, have incurred consequences for doing so. Me: Like the missile that was launched at Hawaii a couple years ago? Ashtar: Exactly. Hawaii is a favourite target because it is part of the remnants of Lemuria. Lemuria was a feminine manifestation on earth and attacking the divine feminine energy is what the dark is about. It's not for no reason your people call it a paradise - it is one of the last vestiges of the feminine upon your planet that survives, a tribute to its strength. You notice that it was the first point of attack in the war in the Pacific, as well. Yes. There was no reason to attack the Americans in the second world war as they were not active, except for a desire to dominate. Hawaii was the real target. Having a strong military force defending the feminine island and pushing the dark invaders back to whence they came was accomplished, so Hawaii lives on. You've been in bases in the South Pacific and you understand that there is still much clearing to do of negative energies. You were contacted by earthbound souls wishing to return home, soldiers of the second world war, and in releasing these souls to go home, the energies of war were lifted from these areas. War energy is a manifestation of pathologically toxified masculinity. All areas need to be cleared of these historic remnant energies, Sharon. Me: Wow! Ashtar: When you think of your wars as a battle to oppress the feminine, then you understand so much more about what is going on on your earth. There are feminine energies still present upon your earth and they are under attack as they are under attack within yourselves. Oppression of the feminine is the only way the dark ones can rule your planet. With her at full strength, they can't survive. And the divine mother is returning. Me: So what do we do about the Corona Virus? Ashtar: People will die. We hold the timelines to minimize the damage. Some are choosing to exit your earth, as it was said, using the catastrophes that befall you in these times of transition as their chosen exit points. Others who have chosen to forge on will remain alive. Understand this is part of Agenda 21, the ""culling of the herd"" as you call it, and understand that it is being committed as an atrocity against humanity on earth by your dark controllers. This deed as well, will not go unnoticed. There will be consequences for those spreading the virus and all involved in its inception will also be tried. All of these events, including SARS, are indictable. As for the virus itself, stay away from areas of infection. It was started in China because China is the most populous country in your world. The likelihood of it spreading before detection is great. Me: How is it spread? Ashtar: Through respiration so it can survive in the air for longer periods of time. Your ""super bugs"" are simply viruses that have been fashioned to eliminate more and more of the population. Your weakened states as a result of the poor foods you eat, mind control and the spread of lower frequency EMFs work together with these bugs to kill you. It's all a plan where one part will complement the other. Your vaccinations, your flu shots, all prepare you to be susceptible to these viruses that are spread. This is how they become pandemics - because your bodies can't fight them. Unfortunately, you are being engineered to die off. The more you partake of your poisonous foods, vaccinations and unhealthy products, the more likely it is you will become diseased or die. It is being engineered, Sharon, these things are all interrelated and deliberate! You understand that fear attracts negativity, so the spread of disease is caused by your fear of it. Not fearing this virus will leave you immune to it. Fear lowers your resistance. That's why the deep state spreads it all over the news and creates panic. You have to be one step ahead of them, Sharon. Fear lowers your vibration, which makes you more susceptible to the virus. The dark can only affect you if you're in a lower vibratory state. Me: Diabolically clever. Yeah, I didn't worry about SARS either, even though I used to meet up with my 12 step friends at a hospital that was treating SARS patients. I'm still here. Ashtar: And indictable. Practise the best hygiene possible and stay away from infected areas. There is a war on and these psychopaths are attempting to kill you. So you have to be cautious - not fearful, just cautious."
William E. 'Bill' Jackman dies after he was diagnosed with covid-19. 	"You could say the late Bill Jackman liked sports. He became a Washington Capitals season-ticket holder in 1974, the hockey team’s inaugural year. He had season tickets to the Washington Bullets, as the city’s basketball franchise was called back then. He was a Baltimore Orioles season-ticket holder during baseball’s long absence from the District, and after the Washington Nationals arrived, guess what: He bought season tickets.
“Going to two games in one day was not unheard of,” his son Tom Jackman recalled.
You could say he enjoyed music, too. He sang throughout his life, as a boy in a church choir in Massachusetts; as a student in the University of Notre Dame Glee Club; and as a tenor in the Oratorio Society of Washington, now the Washington Chorus, which performs at the Kennedy Center and other such lofty venues. Though he came of age with rock-and-roll in the 1950s, he preferred the jazz of Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan.
“He went to the Newport Jazz Festival many times,” said the younger Jackman, a reporter for The Washington Post, “not to mention far less savory jazz joints.”
William E. “Bill” Jackman, 85, a retired press spokesman who loved to travel the world with his wife of 60 years, died this week in an assisted-living facility in Reston, Va., after testing positive for covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus . As of Friday, the death toll from the weeks-old pandemic had surpassed 1,300 in Virginia, Maryland and the District.
AD AD Tom Jackman said his father, who had Alzheimer’s disease and was in declining health generally in recent years, was tested for the illness last Friday at Great Falls Assisted Living. On Monday, the facility told his family that the test was positive. “But they said he seemed okay, that he’s just got a cough,” the son said.
Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.
That night, “he died in his sleep.”
Bill Jackman lived in Reston, grew up in the village of Whitinsville, about 50 miles from Boston, and graduated from Notre Dame in 1956 with a degree in journalism. For a few years, he edited a small newspaper in California’s Mojave Desert, then entered the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Va. Around that time, he met a young Virginia woman named Sigrid Stanley, who was studying at Mary Washington University in nearby Fredericksburg.
AD AD “It was a big deal that she married a Yankee,” Tom Jackman said of his mother. He said each family had trouble understanding the other’s accent.
Over the years, the couple’s travels included trips to China, India, Kenya, Australia and Brazil. They had two sons and a daughter.
For about 23 years starting in the mid-1960s, Bill Jackman, who left the Marines as a captain, was a spokesman for the airline industry’s trade association, now called Airlines for America. Later, until he retired in the mid-2000s, he was national spokesman for AAA.
“If you know me or my brother, you knew him, because he passed his passions directly to us,” Tom Jackman said.
AD Sports, for instance: Besides being an avid spectator, Bill Jackman was the public address announcer — the stadium voice — of U.S. Navy Academy football for three decades. In the 1960s, he was also the basketball public address announcer and part-time sports information director at Georgetown University. “His first task every morning was to read the sports section of The Post,” his son said.
AD He also established “the Jackman family tradition of sprinting to the car right before the end of a game to beat the traffic,” Tom Jackman recalled. He remembered his father’s voice, yelling: “Come on, Tommy! It’s a school night!”
“I hated leaving even a minute early,” he said. “But chasing him in the Cap Centre parking lot is a custom I have now passed on to my own sons.”"
Bras, sanitary pads used as face mask against Corona Virus. 	Anxious and desperate people unable to buy face masks or due to its shortage have deployed fruit rinds and plastic bottle helmets to shield against the deadly coronavirus. Many are using sanitary pads and bra cups as face masks, since they are thicker. Companies have been working overtime to supply citizens with protective masks amid surging demand as cases of the deadly flu-like virus soared to nearly 8,200 today. Social media posts show people donning tangerine and grapefruit skins as masks, water-cooler bottle headgear, while pranksters have mocked the health crisis with absurd alternatives, including iceberg lettuce. It comes as Chinese health officials warned people not to re-use their protective masks after videos emerged of people boiling their surgical masks and hanging them up to dry. Medical experts warned that this greatly reduces the effectiveness of the masks, a spokeswoman for the Gansu province Health Commission added that they should be discarded after just four hours of use. With more than 50 million residents on lock-down and 170 deaths in the country, some provinces such as Guangdong have mandated that people wear masks and are handing out fines for offenders.

Liu Xiaoming:Combat Corona outbreak. 	"China’s ambassador to the United Kingdom has called on all nations to support the fight against the outbreak of novel #coronavirus and urged that people refrain from panicking, because the illness is “preventable”, “controllable”, and “curable”.
China’s ambassador to the United Kingdom has called on all nations to support the fight against the outbreak of novel coronavirus and urged that people refrain from panicking, because the illness is “preventable”, “controllable”, and “curable”.
Liu Xiaoming said: “It is our hope that the governments of all countries, including the UK, should understand and support China’s efforts, respect the professional advice of the WHO, avoid over-reaction, avoid creating panic, and ensure normal cooperation and exchanges between countries.”
He noted during a news conference within China’s London embassy on Thursday that, since the outbreak began, the government has attached “great importance to epidemic prevention and control” and that the nation has demonstrated “a great sense of responsibility”, from the national level all the way to the grassroots communities.
Since the outbreak began, two hospitals were built in a matter of around 10 days in Wuhan, the capital of Central China’s Hubei province. The city is at the heart of the outbreak and the hospitals are part of the massive effort to contain the virus and treat people affected by it.
At least 6,000 medical workers from 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have traveled to Hubei to help with the effort. Some volunteers are veterans of the fight against SARS in 2002/2003.
In addition to taking comprehensive and strict measures domestically, China’s government has attached “great importance to enhancing international cooperation” with the World Health Organization and other nations, Liu noted. "
Indian scientists have just found HIV virus-like insertions in the 2019-nCov. 	"Sorry, but it's very easy to verify that these claims are crap by replicating their study, i.e. doing a simple blast search of the insert sequence against the virus database. Here's the result of the first insert:
Although, there are some hits against HIV, there are also equally matching hits against bacteriophages; viruses that only target bacterias, they are completely unrelated to any viruses that target humans and animals. Furthermore, the E value is around 170, that means that matches are statistically completely insignificant, meaning they happened by chance only. Such a high E value corresponds to a p-value of very, very close to 1 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html ).
These guys that published such a paper are either completely clueless or nefarious in trying to stir up conspiracy theories."

"While all of the assets are losing their sheen as investors turn risk averse amid corona virus spread, the one that has remained immune is Bitcoin. In fact on January 28, 2020, the digital currency has scaled higher to levels last seen in early November. It recorded levels of $9142.80 while other digital assets also rallied in trade. Bitcoin Rallies On Gaining Appeal As Safe Haven Amid Corona Virus Scare
Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index jumped to a 2-month high level and gained to the tune of 1.7%.
In the past week, the bitcoin performed poorly in the run up to Lunar New Year celebrations and there remained expectations that trading in the asset shall remain weak.
The attributes suggested for the rally has been that bitcoin amid corona virus spread has once again gained the status as a safe haven. In a note on Monday, Nomura Securities said that the US 5-year securities have been the most negative since April' 2017 which acts as a major bullish catalyst for gold as well as bitcoin.

Tanzania: Tales of Tanzanians Living China Over Corona Virus Outbreak. 	"Mr Gustav Sanga, a PhD student studying in China says most public places are closed in Xi'an, a province far from Wuhan-the source of the Corona Virus outbreak, as emergency measures to control the outbreak continue. ""... we are not allow to hang around. Everyone must remain indoors, even though we are not in the place where the outbreak emerged,"" says Sanga as he narrates the trials and tribulations of living in a country where an outbreak of the Corona Virus has so far claimed more than 250 lives in China, leaving 11,791 others infected. According to government reports, most fatalities until yesterday were from Hubei province. The city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is located in Hubei. However, the virus is spreading across the world. More than 20 countries now affected, including Spain and the United Kingdom, ACCORDING TO World Health Organization (WHO) Mr Sanga says life in China has changed. ""When you get a chance to go out to buy basic needs, you are obliged to get back into the house immediately. We are advised to wear a face mask to protect ourselves from the disease at all time."" Everyone is worried, he says. ""This is not affecting only the foreigners but also the Chinese peopled because officials here are saying the virus is spreading very fast."" ""Supermarkets are opening for some few hours and closing,"" he tells The Citizen. For another student living in Wuhan, the province where the outbreak begin, she says the government has directed that all public transport be suspended. "
WHO says corona virus is not yet an international concern. 	"The head of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus has declared that the respiratory disease Novel Corona virus is not yet an official Public Health Emergency of International Concern. He, however, warned that the disease is an emergency in China.
The declaration came after two days of deliberations, in which the WHO Emergency Committee remained divided on whether to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
The disease has spread rapidly to several countries including Japan, Singapore and the United States of America, and Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, said in a press conference held in Geneva that the outbreak poses a very high risk in China.
According to the World Health Organisation, 584 cases have now been reported, including 17 deaths. 575 of the reported cases were in China, while the other were in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the United States of America and Vietnam, with further possible cases being investigated in other countries; among them, The United Kingdom.
The WHO chief acknowledged that there are still many unknown factors about the disease.
“We don’t know the source of this virus. We don’t understand how easily it spreads and we don’t fully understand its clinical features or severity… But we know that among those infected, one-quarter of patients have experienced severe disease and that it can kill. We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, that weakened their immune systems.
The WHO chief warned, that the agency’s decision should not be taken as a sign that it is doing nothing adding that the WHO is following the outbreak “every minute of every day,” at a country, regional and global level, to prevent human to human transmission.
He added that the WHO is working with the partner’s in China and the other affected countries at the regional level, and at the headquarters in Geneva, to fill the gaps in the knowledge as quickly as possible.
Ghebreyesus says that the health agency has also provided guidance to all countries for the rapid identification, management and containment of the virus based on the sequence from China.
A statement released by WHO soon after the press conference, noted that the Committee members agree on the urgency of the situation, and suggested the Committee should be reconvened “in a matter of days” to examine the situation further.
All countries, recommends the Committee should be prepared to contain the virus, through active surveillance, early detection, isolation, case management, and prevention of onward spread of infection, and to share full data with WHO.
A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. At the moment, there is no vaccine for the virus. "
Chinese Government are LYING, Corona is SERIOUS. 	Total: 52.2M Important information you should know about the Wuhan Virus: 14 day incubation period, which means everybody who is diagnosed right now, got infected more than a week ago.

R-0 3.8 according to Lancaster study, very high infection rate, if it's accurate we are past the point where this could have been contained, For comparison the Spanish flu had an R0 of around 2 and killed 100 million people This doesn’t just affect the elderly healthy children and adults have now “officially” been reported as dead from the OFFICIAL numbers, we have 41 deaths and 38 recoveries, which gives us a mortality rate of 52%, in reality things are much WORSE, the CCP is covering up hard - You need to login to view this link The Chinese government is LYING, their figures are not accurate, they are covering this up to save face The Quarantine is not a precaution, they are destroying roads and beginning to wall in cities The Quarantine was announced hours before being implemented with 70,000 – 100,000 people already escaping quarantine zones, many bragging that they were showing symptoms.

Corona Kluger. 	"Pandemics are perversely democratic things. They are nasty things, lethal things, yes, but give them this, they don’t discriminate. No matter your age, race, gender, region—no matter your very species in some cases—you’re probably a part of the pathogenic constituency. It’s a global kind of kumbaya—even if it’s the kind that can kill you.
That human collectivism—a universal response to a universal threat—is newly and powerfully evident in the face of the now-global outbreak of coronavirus. As of February 1, there have been 250 deaths, nearly 12,000 diagnosed cases, and a virus that emerged in a single city in China—Wuhan—indeed, in a single crowded market in that single city, has now spread world wide, with cases in TK NUMBER of countries across the Pacific rim as well as in Europe, the Middle east and the U.S. Get our Health Newsletter. latest health and science news, plus answers to wellness questions and expert tips.
“During an outbreak, it takes only a few links to make the global population fully connected,” says Justin lessler, associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “The last time a population was fully isolated was in the 15th century when the Spaniards came to the Americas and brought smallpox with them.”
Half a millennium on, the behavior of viruses hasn’t changed, but the behavior of their human hosts and victims has. If the response to new corona outbreak is showing anything, it’s that in an era of nativism, nationalism and a seeming breakdown of civility itself, we are actually getting better and better, smarter and smarter—and even kinder and kinder—at joining hands to battle a bug that threatens us all.
If there’s one thing that that gives the current coronavirus an edge that pandemics of earlier eras didn’t, it’s our new and growing state of human interconnectedness—with global air travel a force multiplier."

OMG! Now the Kamravirus: It’s deadlier than the Corona, and we can’t even blame China. 	"The Coronavirus threatens the health of the country. The Kamravirus is worse; it threatened the Republic itself and a viral outbreak followed. So the Nation would like to know what’s being done about this worse danger. Aeroplanes are the vector for both strains. You have to have flown in from China to be a potential carrier of the former, but you can get infected by the virulent Kamra even on a domestic sector.
The first known case was detected last week aboard a BOM-LKO flight. The victim was so engrossed in his laptop, that he appeared unaffected. However someone was influential enough to notify the civil aviation ministry. Not waiting for such technicalities as the pilot’s report, the Hon Minister himself swung into action. After all, the Kamra wasn’t just another virus; it was a dangerous breed of anti-National. The IndiGo alert was jumped up to a Red Alert notice for all airlines.
Knowing what a slippery artiste this new bio-terrorist is, all modes of cross-country travel are believed to be in the government’s crosshairs. You are asking how it is possible to put all our remote railway stations and toll-nakas under surveillance? What-ji, you haven’t noticed the increasingly obvious? Big Bhai is watching – everything.
Since airlines were the carriers of the two viruses let’s visualise the drill. The Coronavirus and stand-up comics will join guns, knives, aerosol sprays on the list of banned items. Before take-off, the ‘Fasten Coronavirus Masks’ sign will be switched on. The safety demo will be tweaked to: ‘Should there be a sudden rise in government pressure, the comedian’s mask will have to drop. Co-passengers should remain calm and breathe normally despite the presence of terrorising elements.’ Later, the stewardess will go down the aisle asking, ‘Viral or Non-Viral?’
Before landing, she will announce: ‘Please be careful while opening the overhead bins, since political baggage is prone to shift during flight. Before disembarking please check that you have taken all your belongings with you, spectacles, mobile phone, party affiliations. Thank you for keeping your favourite airline safe from dangerous viruses. Have a pleasant stay in X city. Or a quiet onward journey to your quarantine camp/ stand-up comics’ detention centre.’ * * *

Arab Media Accuses Corona Virus of American And Israeli Conspiracy for Chinese Opponents. 	"Reports in Arab media accused the United States (US) and Israel of being behind the creation and spread of the corona virus as part of the economic and psychological warfare against China, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).
One report in the Saudi Arabian newspaper, Al-Watan claims it is no coincidence that the corona virus does not exist in the US and Israel, even though America has 12 confirmed cases.
""The 'magical' virus was found yesterday in China; tomorrow it will be found in Egypt, but it will not be found today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow in the US or Israel, or in poor countries like Burundi or the Comoro Islands,"" the report said, quoted from The Jerusalem Post, Tuesday (11/2).
The US and Israel have also been accused of being behind other outbreaks in recent years in China and in the Arab world.
New Type of War?
In early February, the Syrian newspaper Al-Thawra also claimed the corona virus and other outbreaks were part of the US-China war.
""From Ebola, Zika, SARS, bird flu and swine flu, anthrax and mad cow disease to the (corona) virus - (all) this deadly virus is produced by the US and threatens to wipe out people in the world,"" the report said.
""(The US) has transformed biological warfare into a new type of war, with which it intends to change the rules of the game and shift conflict with the people (people) away from the conventional path.""
Egypt News Site Report
A report from the Egyptian news site, Vetogate.com, further discussed this conspiracy theory, specifically describing why Wuhan was chosen as the center of the spread of the virus.
""American factories are the first to produce every type of virus and bacteria, from the deadly smallpox virus and the PES virus to all the viruses we have seen in recent years, such as mad cow disease and swine flu,"" the site said.
""Wuhan, the city now hit by the (corona) virus, is an industrial city, but it is after all the eighth richest city in China after Shanghai.""
Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and Hong Kong, are major cities in China. While Wuhan is at the bottom of the list of major cities. Thus, the report said, making it a suitable place for the US to take action.
""The level of health services there is definitely lower than in big cities and more important,"" he said.
The site added, there are economic motives in the spread of this outbreak. The mastermind who is thought to be behind this outbreak will reap billions of dollars spent by China on emergency treatment and medicine.
""Which, by the way, will be produced by Israeli companies,"" he blamed.
More than 37,000 people worldwide have been infected with the corona virus as the epidemic continues to spread. The current death toll is more than 900 people."

Corona virus outbreak. 	Ranger Wrote: It is only in some cases lethal, it causes upper respiratory infections in humans and is a mild virus, its more likely to kill someone with a week immune system, I can confidently bet that the majority of victims that have died are over the age of 60 or had an auto-immune disease. In my opinion its the mainstream media fear mongering yet again, just like they did with the ebola outbreak. Indeed so. Chinese authorities have said that the vast majority of deaths were of people who were either very young, very old, or with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Over 30 people have been discharged from hospital already, meaning current methods can easily treat it. My guess is that China's infamous air quality made it worse Have I helped you or am I friendly?
PANIC AS PATIENTS ARE EVACUTED FROM NHS HOSPITAL: Two patients in waiting room spark fears of corona virus outbreak. 	"Panic spread in an NHS hospital waiting area when two patients that had been waiting alongside others at the New Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Hertfordshire displayed symptoms of the coronavirus.
Staff noticed something wrong with the two people and immediately called a doctor into the room to take a look at them, they had been there for about two hours. Within a few minutes, the doctor took the nurse to one side and that’s when the nurse told everyone they had to be moved.

A 39-year-old witness, who asked not to be named, said: “We were in the waiting room and the nurse said we suspect its coronavirus, can we vacate the waiting room?
“We got moved down a corridor, maybe 40 metres away, into a separate area while they did a disinfectant clean.
“They’d been in there for two hours, one fella was saying ‘I sat next to them for the last two hours.’”
The witness said everybody’s details were taken and they were told they’d be contacted if the tests came back positive.
He said: “We were told: ‘We’ve got all your details, we’re going to do tests, and if it is that, we’ll come back and let you know.’”
The Department of Health & Social Care issued an update today, the department said that 161 tests had been carried out on UK patients, zero of which had come back positive for the coronavirus."
Now, a virus called the Corona virus has become very dangerous in China. 	Now, a virus called the Corona virus has become very dangerous in China Now, a virus called the Corona virus has become very dangerous in China Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah. Hope most are well. Today, i would like to speak about a crucial issue, albeit I even have no such knowledge on Islamic, I couldn't write then . As you all know, an epidemic called corona virus has taken a terrible form in China, causing 1360 deaths thus far and about 60000 still being infected. The virus has spread to quite 20 countries round the world. I are expecting a while online news of our country and a few people have been spreading false news about it. We as Muslims know that lying may be a great sin. Preaching is additionally a sin. Why should we increase our sin by spreading false news .. !! Why are we exposing Muslims to the world? Why shorten Islam ?? I myself sleep in China i do know which is true and which is fake . All the news below is fake . No mosque has been opened in China. Alto those during which prayers are closed are closed. The virus can spread quickly wherever people are high. The Chinese government doesn't believe Islamic matters. If 1 million people die today, the Chinese government won't do this stuff in life, like opening a mosque, getting to mosques, praying, etc. And again many of us call this virus from China the wrath of God. Oh brother out of the 15 million population of Bangladesh, only 500 died in road accidents in January. And China features a population of 150 billion. If 150 million people were living in Bangladesh then you calculate what percentage people would die during a month. Finally, i might urge everyone to not belittle Islam and Muslims by spreading these lies

corona. 	" Why are the Chinese authorities seemingly ignoring the Wuhan Institute Virology’s contemporaneous coronavirus study (culminating in a Dec. 11, 2019 report, published the day before the outbreak) conducted at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, located just 8.6 miles distant from the claimed epicenter of pandemic origin, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market? Why is the media not reporting this?
 Why are most media reports covering the coronavirus still misreporting the source of the virus’ genome sequence as snakes instead of bats?
 Since the Wuhan Institute of Virology has already isolated live, novel SARS-like Coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 from bat droppings in 2016, and such virus has been confirmed to invade the host cells through the ACE2 of human beings just like the new, emergent Coronavirus 2019-nCoV — have the two coronaviruses been compared with each other? Was there a vaccine developed from Coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 that can be tested on victims of the latest outbreak? After all, it’s been about four years now.
 Has any formal investigation been launched into any role the Wuhan Institute of Virology (and specifically, its Classification P4 Biosafety Laboratory) may have played in the pandemic outbreak?
 Did the new coronavirus penetrate the biosecurity measures of Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory? Did some bats mount a successful escape?
 Did any scientists, researchers, professors, observers, students, or other staff persons working at or visiting the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory visit the Huanan Seafood Market in the first twelve days of December, 2019?
 Since the original technology for viral confinement at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory was developed in France, and since most of its actual, functional equipment was imported from France — has the laboratory received ongoing certification inspections from French officials, given its lengthy, ongoing activities using Class 4 pathogens (P4) — the most virulent viruses that pose the highest risk of aerosol-transmitted person-to-person infections? If so, where are the certification test results?
 Has the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory been regularly inspected and audited by Chinese government health officials, especially by Li Bin, minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission? If so, where are the inspection and audit results?
 Could there have been either a staff person or visitor who smuggled out the coronavirus from the laboratory? (After all, a Chinese national was just arrested at Harvard University for attempting to smuggle research vials back to China at the same time when the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak started.)
 At any time did Prof. Zhengli Shi — who simultaneously currently holds the multiple titles of Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator, Director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Director of BSL-3 Labatory, Director of the Committee of Biosafety, Director of Chinese Academy Sciences (CAS) Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, and Vice Director of BSL-4 Laboratory at Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS — ever work directly or indirectly for the CCP military services or military intelligence community?
 Did Prof. Zhengli previously or does she currently co-conduct, coparticipate, collaborate, or collude with CCP military service members or military intelligence members?
 Do members of the CCP military services or military intelligence contribute or participate in any manner or conduct viral research at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory?
 Did Prof. Zhengli or any other faculty member at the Wuhan Institute of Virology take possession, either illicitly or officially, of any biological substance, whether pathogen, vaccine, or other biomatter, originating from the United States or Canada?
 Why did the US National Institute of Health (NIH) grant Prof. Zhengli $665,000 in 2014 to fund her study, The ecology of bat coronaviruses and the risk of future coronavirus emergence? What did the US receive in return?
 Why did the United States Agency of International Development grant Prof. Zhengli $559,500 to fund her study, Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT 2_China? What did the US receive in return?
 Why did Prof. Zhengli receive funding from U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (the agency which deals specifically with Weapons of Mass Destruction), the U.S. Biological Defense Research Directorate of the Naval Medical Research Center, and the Department of Atomic of the Government of India?
 What other professional relationships with U.S. defense agencies does Prof. Zhengli have currently, or previously, in any capacity?
 When Prof. Zhengli received a visa to the United States to present at the Cell Symposium: Emerging and Re-emerging Viruses 2017 conference in Arlington, Virginia, did she visit the Pentagon or meet with Pentagon officials, since it was less than a mile away?
 When Prof. Zhengli received a visa to the United States to present at the US-China Workshop on Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases conference at UC Berkeley in 2018, did she visit Federal research facility, Lawrence-Berkeley-Livermore Laboratory — in particular, the Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute — or meet with government officials, since it was only a mile and a half away?
 Prof. Zhengli’s C.V. indicates she received a visa to the United States to present at the U.S.-China Dialogue on the Challenges of Emerging Infections, Laboratory Safety and Global Health Security conference on January 17, 2018, in Galveston, Texas. However, such a conference appears to not have existed. For what purpose did she really come to Galveston — perhaps to visit the Galveston National Laboratory, a high security National Biocontainment Laboratory housing several Biosafety Level 4 research laboratories, one of the only 15 biosecurity Level 4 facilities in the United States and the largest one in the world located on an academic campus? Was this apparently imaginary conference merely a ruse for a surreptitious rendezvous?
 Of Prof. Zhengli’s 130 published scientific studies, 5 of them are not to be found anywhere. Why are they not public? Are they classified?
 Has Prof. Zhengli (or any other staff, resident or guest scientists, researchers, students, visitors, or others) at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, or at Wuhan Institute of Virology in general, collaborated, participated with, colluded with, or in any way professionally acted in concert or collusion with, or in any way worked with or for, the World Economic Forum, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Pilbright Institute, the European Commission, the World Health Organization, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, or the John Hopkins Center for Health Security?
 Prof. Zhengli recently (January 23, 2020) claimed to know very little about the latest epidemic outbreak, including basic biology, animal source, or any specific treatment, and indicated she doesn’t know if ACE2 targeting drugs could treat Coronavirus 2019-nCoV infected victims. How can this be the case, given that she has studied human ACE2/coronavirus interaction for many years — even most recently in her study immediately preceding the outbreak — as reported in Prof. Zhengli’s study published the day immediately preceding the outbreak? “The full-length genes of MERS-CoV spike (GenBank accession number 415 AFS88936.1), SARS-CoV spike (GenBank accession number AFR58742), human DPP4 416 (GenBank accession number NM_001935.3) and human ACE2 (GenBank accession 417 number NM_021804) were synthesized (GenScript Biotech).”
 Considering Prof. Zhengli is the recipient of millions of dollars in grants and salaries, commands one of the world’s leading, most advanced biosafety laboratories, has performed innumerable research studies into coronaviruses for three decades and counting — what vaccines, to date, has she successfully produced? Has she produced any successful coronavirus vaccines at all? If so, where are they and how have they been publicly administered?"
CDC and USDA Confirm First Two COVID-19 Positive Pet Cats in the. 	"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed on Wednesday that the first two pets to test positive for COVID-19 in the United States are two pet cats from separate parts of New York. Both had mild respiratory illnesses, but are expected to make full recoveries.
""There was a human in the household who was also positive for the virus,"" says Dr. Marianne Bailey. ""In that household there was a second cat who is not showing any signs for the disease at this time. The other cat was in a household that did not have anyone who was positive for the disease.""
Dr. Bailey, who owns the Queenstown Veterinary Hospital, says this could mean the other owner was asymptomatic or that the cat caught COVID-19 from another person or animal outside.
""It does appear that dogs may be more resistant to picking it up than cats or ferrets might be,"" says Bailey. ""We believe that has to do with a receptor in the body that is slightly different between cats and dogs that the virus likes to bind to.""
For now the CDC recommends pet owners do not let their pets interact with people or animals outside of the household. Cats should be kept indoors when possible. Dogs should be walked on leashes and be kept at least 6 feet away from other people or animals. It is also recommended that dog owners avoid public places where dogs and people typically gather, like dog parks.
""When we do the meet and greets, there are only a certain amount of people who can be a part of that process,"" says Brandywine Valley SPCA Marketing Director Linda Torelli. ""We also require everyone who comes into the shelter to wear a mask. Our folks are wearing gloves.""
Torelli says BVSPCA has also ramped up cleaning and that they'll look out for pets with sick owners as health officials recommend sick or COVID-19 positive owners limit exposure to their pets for two weeks.
""If there is a case of COVID-19 and they can't take care of their pet, we do have protocols in place where we would have a 14 day quarantine in place for that pet,"" says Torelli.
Dr. Bailey says at this time there are no pets confirmed to have died from COVID-19. She says only symptomatic pets will be tested and that they'll be treated for their symptoms if necessary as there is no known cure for animals either.
""All of these pets that have tested positive have mild signs, mild cough, mild upper respiratory infection signs,"" says Bailey.
Veterinarians have given more than 5,000 tests to animals in 17 countries. Bailey says the demand is much less than for the human tests.
""It's not the same type of test that is run on humans, Bailey says. ""Cats have very small noses. To do any kind of nasal swab, I don't know that that's possible. My suspicion is it might have possibly been a blood test.""
The CDC and USDA have no evidence yet that animals play a role in spreading COVID-19 in the United States. Should more pets test positive, the USDA will post the findings here ."
Cow dung and urine can cure corona virus, says Hindumahasabha president. 	"As the coronavirus scare runs across the world with one confirmed case in India, Hindu Mahasabha has proposed bizarre treatment for the dreaded virus infection. Swami Chakrapani Maharaj, president of Hindu Mahasabha, on Friday said cow urine and cow dung can be used for treating novel coronavirus disease. He also said that a special yagna will be performed to “kill the novel coronavirus and end its effects on the world”.
“Consuming cow urine and cow dung will stop the effect of infectious coronavirus. A person who chants Om Namah Shivay and applies cow dung on body, will be saved. A special yagna ritual will soon be performed to kill coronavirus,” said Chakrapani.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the new coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency after the death toll in China rose to 213 on Friday, with 9,692 confirmed cases in the country’s 31 provincial-level regions."

Queensland legal practitioners will be able to use video conferencing technology to conduct a range of transactions that usually require face to face meetings, as coronavirus social distancing requirements remain in place.
Attorney-General and Minister for Justice said laws passed in State Parliament allow for more flexible arrangements to conduct important and pressing legal transactions.
“There are a number of requirements across the statute book as well as the common law which requires a thing to be done in person,” she said.
“This includes the witnessing of documents, attendance at meetings or a visit or inspection by an authorised person of a particular site.
“Currently, social distancing requirements and other COVID-19 related restrictions make it difficult or impossible to meet those requirements safely or on time.”
Mrs D’Ath said the new laws allow regulations to be made which will enable courts to be responsive to health advice for the protection of individuals and the community, while continuing to deliver justice for Queenslanders.
“While social distancing remains in place, these laws enable our courts to adopt alternative processes that still serve the interests of justice, while keeping more people safe and at home,” she said. 10.40am. Police have seen it all on Queensland’s borders

West Moreton Health has had no new confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the start of April.
The region’s confirmed cases have stayed at 37.
Of West Moreton Health district’s 37 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 11 remain active while 26 have now recovered.
There were two new cases recorded in Queensland yesterday maintaining this week’s encouragingly low results.
There are now 282 active cases with 738 recoveries and six deaths for a total of 1026.
Queensland Health’s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said currently, 955 of the 1,026 confirmed cases had recently travelled overseas or had close contact with a confirmed case, such as their partner or flatmate.
“We’ve continued to see limited community transmission in Queensland, with 42 cases where we don’t know the source of infection,” Dr Young said.
“It’s encouraging that numbers are staying very low this week, with only eight cases recorded so far, and we want to keep it that way.
“Queenslanders continue to be reminded to stay home as much as possible, and stay in their suburb when undertaking essential activities such as going to the supermarket or exercising,” she said.
Dr Young said a total of 92,699 tests for COVID-19 has been undertaken in Queensland, with 2,539 tests undertaken in the previous 24 hours.
Most Queenslanders who have contracted COVID-19 have experienced mild symptoms.
Currently, 20 of the 282 active confirmed cases are in hospital, with seven of these in intensive care. The remainder of active cases are currently recovering at home.
Contact tracing continues for recent cases.
Queensland Health asks residents to continue practising good hygiene and staying home, especially if sick.
Washing hands properly and often is the gold standard of health advice that can help prevent viruses from entering the body.
A person will generally be tested if they have a fever (or history of fever) or acute respiratory symptoms, and, in the last 14 days: they were a close contact or a household contact of a confirmed case they had been overseas, including on a cruise. Testing may also be done for people who have a fever (or history of fever) or acute respiratory symptoms, AND: live or work in a high-risk setting such as healthcare, aged or residential care, military, correction facility, detention centre or boarding school work in a school or child care setting or are a Queensland Police Officer live in: Brisbane (residents within the Metro North and Metro South Hospital and Health Services boundaries ) Gold Coast or Cairns (the area bounded by and including Palm Cove to the north, Mareeba to the west, and Gordonvale to the south) live in or travelled from a COVID-19 hotspot live in or travelled from another state live in a First Nations community.
Queensland Health is urging anyone who meets this criteria for testing, to contact a doctor immediately.
Before your appointment, call ahead and advise of your symptoms and recent travel they can prepare for your visit. Keep up-to-date with local information "
Illinois rents fleet of refrigerated trailers as COVID-19 morgue contingency. 	"Illinois has rented a fleet of refrigerated semi-truck trailers to store the bodies of deceased COVID-19 patients in case morgues become filled to capacity, according to a spokesperson for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.
The “more than 20” trailers rented by the state thus far are “part of the state’s response to expand mortuary capacity,” IEMA spokesperson Rebecca Clark said in an email.
“These structures are being retrofitted for medical examiners throughout the state should a need arise,” she said.
Clark said 12 counties – Bureau, Champaign, Hamilton, Kane, Kankakee, LaSalle, Lee, Piatt, Wayne, Whiteside, Will and Williamson – have requested trailers be “pre-positioned in the event there is a need.”
“Pre-positioning resources is a common practice in emergency management to ensure an entity is prepared to respond to a potential need,” she added.
The state rented at least 10 trailers from Cooling Concepts LLC, located in Belleville, according to a Tuesday invoice published on the comptroller’s office’s running total of state COVID-19-related expenditures. The invoice of $29,137.02 is for the “rental of 10 refrigerator trailers for COVID-19 response.”
Don White, Vice President of Business Development at Cooling Concepts, said in an email that the privacy policy built into all of the company’s contracts prevents it from disclosing information on the matter. He added that Cooling Concepts “specializes in equipment for food delivery, food storage, and pharmaceutical delivery, and pharmaceutical storage.”
Cook County, which had recorded 1,142 of the state’s 1,688 COVID-19 deaths as of Thursday, already has refrigerated trailers of its own. An April 9 news release said the county acquired 14 refrigerated trailers and was in the process of securing six more to support a refrigerated warehouse that can hold more than 2,000 decedents.
Cook County’s trailers will be pre-positioned at hospitals experiencing surges so their morgues are not overwhelmed, according to the release.
“We do not anticipate needing any space beyond what we have already acquired,” said Natalia Derevyanny, a county spokesperson.
Refrigerated trailers have been used by hospitals in states such as New York, Massachusetts and Tennessee as overflow morgue capacity.
As of Thursday, according to Illinois Department of Public Health data, Will County has recorded Illinois’ second-most total deaths from COVID-19 with 119, followed by DuPage County with 118 and Lake County with 100. Remaining counties have recorded fewer than 40 each.
A model released by Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration on Thursday shows peak deaths are projected to be between 50 and 150 per day from now through the first week in May. Over the past week, Illinois has twice seen 125 deaths in a day, its largest daily increase. Thursday’s reported death toll was 123.

Love in the time of Corona. 	"BE CAREFUL who you go out with on Valentine’s Day.
Beyond the normal qualifications of a good date comes a new criteria for dating, this time, from an unlikely source — the Department of Health (DOH).
The DOH says, before going on a date, you should know the person’s travel history to protect yourself from deadly viruses.
Bernadas also advised people with flu-like symptoms and those who recently traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong or Taiwan to avoid dating for now.
“Avoid if they have travels to China or contacts (with a history of travel to China),” Bernadas said.
To prevent the spread of the dreaded novel coronavirus (Covid-19), DOH advised the public to practice frequent handwashing and proper cough etiquette, avoid close contact with people showing flu-like symptoms, ensure that food is well cooked and avoid contact with farm or wild animals.
Meanwhile, a random survey conducted by SunStar Cebu showed that public jitters regarding the suspected Covid-19 cases in the country failed to dampen couples’ resolve to celebrate a meaningful Valentine’s Day while taking precautionary measures against the Covid-19.
Carl James Cabarles, a government employee, said he and his girlfriend plan to watch a movie after celebrating at home with his family.
“Our plan is to go out for a while after work, maybe buy food or ice cream then go to our house to celebrate with the family and then watch a movie,” he said.
Rutchielle Fae Zaragoza, who works for a shipbuilding company, said her family opts to hold a simple celebration at home away from crowded malls and fast food restaurants.
“We will stay at home after duty. Besides, it’s safe and nice to be with family,” she said.
Kenneth Dwight Torres, a multimedia editor said, this year, he and his girlfriend plan to celebrate Valentine’s drinking with their peers in an “exclusive karaoke session.”
“Amid the Covid-19 threat, we already set some preemptive measures to combat the infectious disease like sticking to the basics, wearing a face mask and no to sharing drinking cups,” Torres said."
Corona Virus. 	"Corona Virus Corona Virus, it must be worse than Ch admits Rushing to build new hospitals & locking down whole cities , they wouldnt do that unless they were really panicked.

China Refused American Offer of Assistance in Studying Corona Virus Outbreak: US Health Chief. 	"The Chinese Communist Party has declined an offer by the United States to send a group of health experts to China, U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a press conference on Jan. 28.
The United States conveyed the offer through multiple channels, including Azar speaking to a top Chinese official, but China has so far refused to allow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) team to assist with efforts to study the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
“We do hope that the Chinese government will take us up” on the offer, Azar said. “CDC experts are standing by, ready to go to China.”
He told Chinese officials at the press conference, “More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take.”
The CDC team and experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) could help Chinese health workers answer some critical questions surrounding asymptomatic transfer of the virus, or the spread from people who don’t show symptoms to other people, and the incubation period, which is so far pegged at 2 to 14 days.
Officials at the press conference acknowledged Chinese officials have said that the virus spreads from people who don’t show symptoms but said they haven’t been able to see that data.
The teams would also try to obtain more live isolates to help develop therapy and vaccines. American officials are proceeding now as if they’ll have to deploy a vaccine.
CDC and WHO workers are the best in the world, Azar said.
“We basically just need the best public health people in the world working on it right now,” he said.
While urging the Chinese government to accept help from America, Azar noted that he lived through the SARS outbreak and said the level of cooperation and interaction between China and the rest of the world was “completely different” and commended them for that.
The CDC has an office in China, embedded in the country’s CDC.
Azar spoke shortly after the Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A WHO statement said the pair agreed that WHO will send international experts to visit China “as soon as possible” to work with Chinese counterparts.
Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHOs highest priority, said Dr. Ghebreyesus in a statement. We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, including sharing data and genetic sequence of the virus.” Travel Restrictions
Azar, meanwhile, asked about reports that the Trump administration is considering restricting travel to or from China, said it was an option that was being considered.
“It’s important to not take anything off the table with a rapidly emerging novel infectious disease,” he said.
No decision on travel restrictions has been made as of yet.
American experts are examining how quickly the disease can spread and verifying reports from other countries of asymptomatic transmission.
The CDC and the State Department said this week that people should avoid nonessential travel to China.
“This warning is in response to an ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a Novel (new) Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spreading between people in many parts of that country,” the CDC said.
“Sustained person-to-person community spread with this virus is reportedly occurring in China,” it said, adding, “A number of travel-associated cases of 2019-nCoV infection also have been identified in other locations, including the United States.”"
LaTribuna Christian Publishing Reports on How to Protect Ourselves and Our Loved Ones from The Corona-Virus. 	 Chaplain Paul Vescio has served as a Community Chaplain in healthcare for over ten years now and has written an e-book entitled How To Protect Our Families in American Health Care. (1888PressRelease) January 31, 2020 - Phoenix, AZ - Chaplain Paul Vescio has served as a Community Chaplain in healthcare for over ten years now and has written an e-book entitled How To Protect Our Families in American Health Care. Chaplain Paul Vescio CEO of LaTribuna Christian Publishing is quoted saying, The flu and the Corona-Virus is yet another wake up call in a long string of very harmful viruses. The question is, how to better protect our selves and our loved ones from possible infection? The answer or I should say part of the solution is in washing hands often, The CDC recommends washing hands often in order to reduce the risk of infection. Think about how many things we touch in a single day. The gas pump and the credit card machines, the elevator buttons, all of the buttons at the self checkout at the grocery store. The grocery cart, door handles, faucets, our cell phones, computer keys, handles, money, we touch and handle things in the store all the time. The list goes on and on and we don't even think about the fact that infection is easily spread this way. Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, If you or someone in your family is dealing with the flu then it wouldn't hurt to have that person wear a surgical mask and gloves. This helps to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals. If you or some one in your family works in a nursing home or hospital setting then have them remove their shoes when they return home. Use bleach wipes to disinfect shoes. Wipe down all can goods, bottles and containers before bringing them into your home. Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands often, as a Community Chaplain I see all to often how easy infection spreads in a hospital setting. Remember try not to cough or sneeze into your hands, stay home if you are sick. Do not visit anyone in a hospital or nursing home setting if you are sick or even have a cold. Above all pray for God's guidance, protection and love in these matters and remember what proverbs 3:5-6 teaches, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths...Amen LaTribuna Christian Publishing supports educating the public on how infection spreads and how we as a nation can best prevent the spreading of infection.

Church cures Corona. 	I found this out through the encouragement of the reverand Rachel Ross. The new vicar at saint clement's is the Rev. Sandra.2002 and three medical professors from the Moffitt cancer centre used high intensity ultrasound to clear cancer at one session. 1 minute of 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound clears all cancers, even lung and breast cancer! As I found out in church. £9.90 + £2.99 P&P 2012 and a personal contact in New York I applied ½ minute of HIUS to each side use chest and cured his HIV AIDs. ½ minute to the lower right of the rib cage clears type two diabetes. That type one only remits in three days, or 1 minute of HIUS.½ minute of HIUS to the top left to the chest the kidneys, totally clears coronary heart disease. 1 minute to the top left to the chest clears obstructive heart disease.I also found ½ minute of HIUS to each side of the head, clears MS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia and depression. Conditions medicine can't cure. And now no registered Dr. Is allowed to research biochemical treatments for these conditions, medicine will never have an effective treatment for them.I found ½ minute of HIUS to each side the chest will clear all bacterial and viral infections. Not just AIDs. It will even clear the common cold and flu. Christianity in China - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org › wiki › Christianity_in_China Jump to Chinese Independent Churches - Main article: Chinese Independent Churches ... to join the Three-Self Church—China Christian Council, ...The ultrasound at sets off molecular nuclear fusion in the pressurised cell structures, common to all bacterial and viral infections. Pluss cancers, heart disease and diabetes. 1H2O+HIUS->He+O+E2+X-raySo just one external application and the pathogen cells will pop. Inducing secretion and actioning of the human antibody to clear the specific virus.2020 and China has experience the Corona virus. There medics are painfully aware that they can do nothing useful: keep away from hospitals!Feeble can buy a a medically licensed ultrasound massage device over the Internet. And clear all viral antibiotic tolerance infections. Basically it cures any future epidemics.As pathogens involve, the human antibody adapts. They human immune system is the most dynamic and adaptive immune system in existence.So by under 20 UK pounds, a where the came clear Corona. All registered doctors bought and validated the cancer cure 2002, or ceased to be registered doctors. Subsequent medical practice all criminal.Even doctors have the required HIUS device in the nursing office, to clear all viral infections. Xi Jinping must come and the Chinese FDA, to instruct all their doctors to use the HIUS device they already own to cure all viral and bacterial infections. Corona totally cured in 1 minute!The epidemic suddenly stopped. The Chinese State should stop the persecution of Christianity. Who after all, have been instrumental in curing Corona for them. 
BIG NEWS: White House Asks Scientists To Investigate Whether 2019-nCoV Was Bio-Engineered.

( Zero Hedge ) A week ago, we published details that raised questions about the source of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, specifically questioning the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market as a fabricated farce.
Source – Zero Hedge

The real reason behind the viral spread, we suggested, was that a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada ) , was released by Wuhan’s Institute of Virology (presumably accidentally ) , China’s only top, level-4 biohazard lab, which was studying “ the world’s most dangerous pathogens .”
At the time we summarized the series of dots and asked “real reporters” to connect them: One of China’s top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China’s top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp . Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world. His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ( such as the STING pathway in bats ) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are “superbug” Coronavirus strains, which are resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections. Peng’s work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National “You Qing” Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Of course, that is all ancient history and Zero Hedge was permanently banned from Twitter for raising such a conspiracy theory about a publicly-searchable person working a publicly-searchable place.
But, bygones being bygones, we moved on… until today when no lesser entity than The White House began asking questions about the origin of the deadly coronavirus.
As ABC News reports, the director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts “rapidly” look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and “to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.”
Specifically, ABC News’ Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about concerns that stem from misinformation online that the novel coronavirus could have been engineered or deliberately released .
“There’s always that concern ,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said.
“And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there’s even any possibility much less likelihood that that’s going on . And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.” Buy Folic Acid, USDA Certified & Vegetarian, Ultimate Prenatal Vitamin, 360 Tablets
The White House has good reason to question the official story as evolutionary biologist Dr. James Lyons-Weiler of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge , showed and explained how the coronavirus’ genetic sequence – which has been publicly released by China – contains a unique “middle fragment” encoding a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spike protein that appears, according to his genomic analysis, to have been inserted into the 2019-nCoV virus using “pShuttle” technology. This technique can only be done in a lab, as it has never occurred naturally in nature.
“This isn’t a ‘conspiracy theory’, it is a scientific, medical theory,” says Del Bigtree, the Emmy-winning producer and founder of non-profit Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).
“Its foundation is based on sound science, logic, and research, and the mainstream media needs to be asked whether it is going to pursue this link to SARS instead of trying to censor anyone who is trying to pursue truth via scientific fact .”
One additional, major reason we suspect this line of logical reasoning could be correct – as conspiratorial as it may seem – is that Chinese authorities have launched a full-scale crusade to disprove the fact that this deadly virus was man-made.
“Conspiracy theorists don’t believe in science. I hope that the national professional department will investigate and give us an innocence,” Shi Zhengli, a director at the Wuhan Institute of Virology – the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China – responded to Caixin on February 4.
Faced with external doubts and accusations, on February 2nd, Shi Zhengli responded angrily in the WeChat circle of friends:
“ The new coronavirus in 2019 is a punishment for uncivilized living habits of human beings by nature . It doesn’t matter. I advise those who believe and spread rumours of bad media, believe in the so-called academic analysis that Indian scholars do not rely on, and close your mouth. “ Book Healing Depression the Mind-Body Way: Creating Happiness with Meditation, Yoga, and Ayurveda
Additionally, as The Washington Times reports, one ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is the that false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.
That could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhan’s civilian or defense research laboratories .
As a reminder, it was discovered that Shi Zhengli had participated in a study published in Natural Medicine on November 9, 2015, about a disease that can be caused by a SARS-like coronavirus (SHC014-CoV) found in Chinese horseshoe bats .
The researchers used the SARS reverse genetics system to generate and identify a chimeric virus. In simple terms, this chimeric virus consists of the surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of the SARS virus. The chimeric virus can infect human respiratory cells, demonstrating that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to key receptors on cells and infect cells. Chimeras can cause disease in mice, but they are not lethal. Studies have shown that viruses currently circulating in bat populations could potentially trigger the potential risk of SARS-CoV (SARS virus) outbreaks .
We are sure this is all just a coincidence – Wuhan epicenter… Only P4 facility in China… A lab investigating bats infected with genetically engineered Coronavirus… Coronavirus infected Bats… Chimeric bio-engineered viruses…. and that is probably why The White House is now asking authorities to investigate the source of the disease.
Of course, when Zero Hedge suggested the same thing, highlighting key personnel in the Wuhan lab that were publicly acknowledged as responsible for that research, we were immediately banned by Twitter. We look forward to reading Buzzfeed’s article decrying The White House for daring to ask questions about the origin of this deadly pandemic.

Fear Allah, Worship him alone: Watch, as Islamic cleric warns ‘children of Godse’ of China like fate where people are dying of Corona virus. 	"In an outlandish statement, controversial Muslim cleric Ilyas Sharafuddin has stated that Allah has punished the Chinese by unleashing Corona virus on them for their brutal crackdown on Uighur Muslims.
In an audio address, Ilyas called the deadly Corona virus outbreak as a punishment of Allah on China for mistreating Uighur Muslims.
“Remember how they have threatened the Muslims and tried to destroy lives of 20 million Muslims. Muslims were forced to drink alcohol, their mosques were destroyed and their Holy Book was burned. They thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful punished them,” said Ilyas. - Ad - - article resumes -
Remember Romans, Persian, and Russians who were arrogant and stood against Islam but all were destroyed by Allah, said Ilyas.
Launching an attack on Hindus, the controversial cleric warned the right-wing outfits in India to refrain from attacking the Muslims and called them “Children of Godse” and “Hindutva terrorists”.
“Beware! Fear Allah before it is too late. Worship him alone. Do not stop people from going to Masjids, do not stop Muslims from practising Islam, otherwise, you too along with the Chinese will be destroyed,” said the rabid hate-mongering cleric.
He says that those (in India) having enmity against Islam and persecuting ‘innocent Muslims’ should “fear Allah” before it’s too late.
The deadly coronavirus has wreaked havoc in China, taking the death toll to 170 and the confirmed infection cases to nearly 7,000. Meanwhile, health experts have warned that the epidemic may reach its peak in the next 10 days resulting in large-scale casualties.
The Central Hubei province is the epicentre of the virus. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days. "

These Chinese are a nation of snake oil as people put it on their armpits.their heads,their hands, and their ars. The addiction to snake oil and bat balls is primary the reason this virus threatens the planet and viruses and bacteria is the result of a planet of the Chinks. Eddie Schwartz says that instead of eating cows and chicken , the Chinese people have breed and forced themselves upon women the one billion or so plus people in China have been reduced to eating any meat that walks or flies next to their staple of white rice with no fucking taste. Schwartz was horrified to read some animal stories in the news about this Coronoavirus being started by the new prosperity of China' upper classes enjoying a night out with friends and sharing drinks of Coronoa cheap Mexican industrial beer along with Bat Blood soup in many of these disgusting and unsanitary Chinese kitchens and restaurants that do the Chinese
landscape. Chinese food is disgusting and only corruption explains why there must be more fucking Chinese restaurants than factories and Mr Schwartz also put blame of the Chinese habit of purchasing snake oil and other bullshit herbs,and animal organ medicine for helping to spread and create this new Coronovirus. Some are fifty a million people will be dead by the spring by the nasty Chinese habit of drinking snake blood and eating Bat Soup."
Some people wrongly linking the coronavirus with Corona the beer. 	"The beer company says it trusts drinkers to know the difference.
“By and large, consumers understand there’s no linkage between the virus and our beer/business,” a spokeswoman for Constellation Brands, Corona’s parent company, said Monday.
Coronaviruses are common, and many cause only mild illnesses, including the common cold. The new one identified in China is different, causing more severe illness, including pneumonia .
That one is more similar to the coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
Chinese health officials have reported more than 20,000 cases. Cases also have been reported in other countries, including the United States.

DOF: 2019 nCoV not enough to force ‘dramatic’ reduction in economic growth. 	"The 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) is unlikely to dramatically drag Philippine economic growth below the government target, according to the Department of Finance (DOF).

""While these developments might slightly restrain our economic expansion, these threats are not enough to force a dramatic reduction in our growth estimates,"" he explained in a presentation before the Senate health committee on Tuesday.
""We are standing by our working projection of a GDP growth rate between 6.5% and 7.5% for 2020,"" added Dominguez.

Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing
Quote: Back at the beginning of 2019, I predicted that there would be a link between 5G and a fake virus, hey presto! The area that is the epicentre of the so called virus is the same area that has reportedly been the province that 5G was rolled out with base stations.
Then we have the company Huawei offering to help combat the so called virus with their 5G base stations. I hope people wake up to this fraud that is being played out with Agenda 20/30 in mind, this is no joke.
I documented a company called InOvio about eight years ago.
This same company have just been given 9 million dollars to come up with a vaccine for corona virus. They claim they were able to do so in two hours!
The fact that they can claim to have a vaccine for a non existent virus in two hours proves that it is all fake.
INOVIO
The pioneer of DNA vaccinations is a man called Dr Weiner. This is the same man involved in the Zika vaccine.
In 2000 Dr Kim and Dr Weiner began a company called InOvio, they first had a company called VGX.
Dr Joseph Kim, teamed up with his university lecturer called Professor Weiner, who is the leading DNA technology inventor, created a few companies one was called Inovio, in which the Professor was the chairman.
The DNA technology was first used on pigs, to make pigs breed at a younger age
.Dr Kim was funded by Merck for his education, he produced something called PCV2 which is Porcine Circovirus, they were working on a veterinary drug that would help pigs escape a wasting disease.
So this was evaluated by the Dept of Homeland Security and Plum Island animal research, this DNA plasma for pigs had approval in 2005, in 2009, the swine flu vaccines were filing for a patent.
In 2009 Dr Kim’s company was filing with FDA to start trials on humans for the swine flu.
Dr Kim has many Merck Insiders on his board.
They created PCV1 and 2, which is Pig DNA.
Later on PVC1 and PCV2 were discovered in vaccines such as Gardasil, Rotatec and Rotarix.
A couple of years after they were given the patent for this pig DNA vaccine using PCV2 that same ingredient was found to be in Merck’s Rotarix vaccine for diarrhoea and GSK vaccine Rotateq for diarrhoea.
Now how does pig virus magically turn up in a vaccine for diarrhoea?It doesn’t! It gets put there. And what is unbelievable is that even though both vaccines were suspended and it transpired that all the vaccines for 2 years had been contaminated , the FDA suspended them for a few months then let them carry on.(The Information about the two drugs being suspended was found on the Medworm website and the article was written by Dr Kim).
Reports are now claiming that the coronavirus is linked to seafood after many people were reported to have contracted coronavirus from a seafood, 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
It has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste….
Prof Weiner is not only the worlds DNA technology expert but he is also a special employee and adviser to the FDA.
He has perfected a new method of giving these DNA vaccines via Electroporation which is a electro magnetic pulse that opens up the cells, injects foreign DNA and then it closes.
The system has been stated by Molecular Biologists to be unsafe as it could lead to death or cancer.
They stated that only human antibody in genes is safe.
This is the same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the corona virus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology!
So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged.
They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death."

Extensive measures are also being taken to prevent the Corona virus in Pakistan. In a statement released on social media in this regard, Assistant Special Health Minister Dr Zafar Mirza said that Pakistan had acquired the ability to diagnose corona.
Dr. Zafar Mirza said that Praise be to Allah, today Pakistan is capable of diagnosing corona virus for which I applaud the NIH leadership and the team for their hard work in securing the reagent for the diagnosis of the virus. "
Without a single COVID-19 death, Vietnam starts easing its coronavirus lockdown. 	"Without a single COVID-19 death, Vietnam starts easing its coronavirus lockdown Offering a rare and surprising bright spot in the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam began easing its nationwide lockdown Thursday following an aggressive containment campaign that has meant few infections and no deaths in an Asian nation initially believed to be at great risk from the coronavirus.
The communist-ruled country has sealed its borders, quarantined masses of people, used soldiers and police to track down potential infections and fined social media users for spreading misinformation. After deploying the full arsenal of a single-party state, the sprawling nation of 95 million people has now gone a full week without recording a new infection.
But despite their effectiveness, Vietnam's measures are not easily replicable. Its intolerance of dissent and ability to mobilize an entire security and political apparatus - steps more common in China - meant its campaign met little of the pushback seen in Western liberal democracies.
And experts caution that the fight isn't over. Starting Thursday, Vietnam allowed residents across the country to resume small gatherings and restarted buses, taxis and regular domestic flights for the first time in three weeks. But with much of Southeast Asia still under lockdown, people must continue wearing masks in public, gatherings of more than 20 remain off-limits, schools will stay closed for several more weeks and international flights are still grounded, officials said.
""Many parts of the world are still infected, so the risk is not over for us,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said this week.
Since the government imposed a partial nationwide lockdown April 1, Vietnam saw only a modest increase in coronavirus cases to 268, with all but 44 recovered and no fatalities.
The numbers are stunningly low considering that Vietnam - which shares a border with China - was among the first countries where the virus spread and lacks the resources of governments more celebrated for their containment strategies, such as South Korea's widespread testing and Taiwan's aggressive digital surveillance.
Its results stand out even more as other Southeast Asian countries struggle. Wealthy Singapore, once regarded as a model, has seen infections skyrocket among migrant workers living in overcrowded dormitories. Indonesia, the largest country in the region, initially ignored the threat and now has the most COVID-19 deaths in Asia after China.
""It's pretty amazing,"" said Huong Le Thu, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. ""I'm cautious of calling Vietnam a success story. It's too early to be out of the woods. But the measures have been quite effective so far.""
Experts credit Vietnam's early, decisive steps: swiftly banning nearly all travel from China, suspending schools in mid-January even before recording any infections, quarantining tens of thousands of people and employing the extensive Communist Party apparatus to communicate distancing measures and trace the contacts of COVID-19 patients.
The response was made possible by a Leninist one-party system that is often criticized for maintaining secrecy, silencing dissent and trampling on individual rights - but that has proven adept at tackling health crises since it was the first nation to stamp out the SARS epidemic nearly two decades ago.
""Only a few countries can control and mobilize resources on this scale,"" said Le Hong Hiep, a Vietnam analyst at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. ""In Vietnam they can do it, and partly because of a political system that's designed to respond to such situations. It's not always good, but in a crisis it helps.""
The sweeping measures often led to large numbers of people being isolated over just a handful of infections.
In February, when a group of Vietnamese workers tested positive for the virus after returning from Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the source of the outbreak, authorities locked down their entire commune of 10,000 people for three weeks - the first mass quarantine outside China.
Last month, more than 300 medical staff, police, soldiers and civilians were deployed to track down the contacts of a British pilot believed to be the origin of a coronavirus cluster at a bar in Ho Chi Minh City. Authorities sealed off several businesses and quarantined thousands of people in their apartments.
In recent weeks, as imported infections surged across Asia, Vietnam placed tens of thousands of incoming travelers - whether they showed COVID-19 symptoms or not - in quarantine at army barracks, university dorms and other public facilities.
As precautionary steps, they were aggressive, perhaps overly so. But they kept pressure off of Vietnam's hospitals and allowed contact tracers to focus on a relatively small number of clusters.
""What we know now is this virus spreads from pre-symptomatic people, and if you're only monitoring people when they get symptoms it's too late,"" said Todd Pollack, a Harvard Medical School infectious disease specialist who leads a health initiative in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi.
American officials have been struck by Vietnam's low infection rate. Experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Vietnam - who have provided assistance in testing, data analysis and contact tracing - say they ""don't have any indication that those numbers are false,"" Dr. John MacArthur, the center's director in Thailand, said on a conference call with reporters last week.
This week, state media reported that tests of more than 1,000 shoppers in Hanoi markets and more than 19,000 travelers at airports and train stations in Ho Chi Minh City found no infections, bolstering the belief that the outbreak has been contained.
Its success has allowed Vietnam to begin playing the role of benefactor - a subtle challenge to its sometime rival China - donating hundreds of thousands of masks to Europe and its Southeast Asian neighbors.
This month Hanoi expedited the shipment to the U.S. of nearly half a million protective medical suits manufactured at a DuPont factory in Vietnam, earning a thank-you tweet from President Trump.
This morning, 450,000 protective suits landed in Dallas, Texas. This was made possible because of the partnership of two great American companies-DuPont and FedEx-and our friends in Vietnam. Thank you! @DuPont_News @FedEx pic.twitter.com/8yhG6tYnQW
- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2020
Analysts say Vietnam's turbulent relationship with China influenced its response to the outbreak. Days after China reported the first death from the virus Jan. 11 - and before any cases had surfaced in Vietnam - the health ministry held a high-level meeting with U.S. and World Health Organization officials to lay out a containment plan.
At the core of Vietnam's concern was the suspicion ""that the scale of the outbreak was much higher than what is officially reported by China,"" Le said. That skepticism turned out to be well founded as China was accused of suppressing initial reports about how fast the virus was spreading.
This week, the U.S. cybersecurity company FireEye reported that hackers linked to the Vietnamese government had attempted to break into the email accounts of Chinese emergency management officials and authorities in Wuhan beginning in January - ostensibly to learn more about the outbreak.
""Vietnam understands China better than some other countries,"" Le said. ""Because of the similar political systems, they know how China works, and they know the risks and downsides of such systems. They know there may be problems in China's data. So in dealing with China, Vietnam is very cautious."""

Bharatpur Hospital sets up isolation ward for corona virus patients. 	Kathmandu, 1 February : Bharatpur Hospital has maintained high alert after the epidemic of corona virus spread from neighbouring country China. For the patients suspected of corona virus, it has set up an isolation ward. According to hospital officials, an isolation ward has been established for the suspected of corona virus patients in case of detection and prompt action. At the initial phase isolation ward has five beds.
Identification of a pangolin niche for a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus through an extensive meta-metagenomic search. 	In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which that sequence is present. Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the keyword virome. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the 2019-nCoV sequence, we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al.. Our observations are relevant to discussions of the derivation of 2019-nCoV, and illustrate the utility of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.

Corona Virus. 	There are rumors and videos leaking out over social media where healthy people are randomly being taken away too for seemingly no reason; I wouldn't put it past the CCP to use this as a time to also politically purge those who they don't like. No one is supposed to post any information about it on social media and if you do you're getting at best a knock from the police who will tell you to delete it and post an apology or at worst being taken down and locked up, or placed in a torture chair for forced confessions
Barangays with Covid-19 cases restrict movement, resort to isolation. 	"AS THE coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to spread, village chiefs in Cebu City barangays with recorded cases see the need to implement immediate isolation of affected areas.
Although it was Mayor Edgardo Labella who declared a total lockdown in Sitio Zapatera, Barangay Luz on April 17, 2020, other barangays are also taking their own steps to restrict and limit movement in their respective jurisdiction.
In Barangay Cogon Ramos, village chief Omar Durano Sr. said all entry and exit points are regulated, which means that outsiders or non-residents are not allowed to enter the premises.
Those who need to go in and out are required to register on a logbook for monitoring.
Durano said residents with influenza-like illness will be monitored by barangay health workers, or they will be brought to the health center.
Cogon Ramos earlier recorded one Covid-19 patient, who has since been tagged as laboratory-negative.
In Barangay Labangon, a lockdown has been in place since last April 22, in a bid to contain the spreas of the novel coronavirus.
With 27 Covid-19 cases, barangay captain Victor Buendia said they have prepared the Labangon Elementary School as an isolation facility for patients.
Buendia, though, clarified that delivery of essential goods and other basic services are still allowed despite a lockdown in the area.
He urged frontliners such as medical workers and persons rendering delivery services to call the barangay hall should they be barred from entering the area. They may also raise their concerns via landline through 260-7194.
Meanwhile, officials of Barangay Kasambagan have implemented restrictions at the area where a 58-year-old male patient lives.
The barangay’s first Covid-19 case was logged on April 22.
According to Kasambagan’s official page, the patient was from Sitio Panagdait. He is admitted at a hospital.
In coordination with the City Health Department, swab samples were taken from the immediate family of the patient and his neighbbors.
In Mambaling, barangay captain Gines Abellana is only waiting for a “go signal” from Mayor Labella so that he can implement a lockdown in Sitio Tinabangay 1 where a Covid-19 patient lives.
With around 1,500 residents, Abellana said they immediately cordoned the area to limit movement.
As of April 24, Cebu City has 348 Covid-19 patients with six mortalities and 16 laboratory-negative. "
Corona Fear: Nokia To Stay Away From Mobile World Congress In Barcelona. 	Nokia Corp. (NOK) cancelled its plan to participate at the Mobile World Congress or MWC in Barcelona, due to concern on coronavirus outbreak.Nokia said it took the decision after a full assessment of the risks related to a fast-moving situation. The primary focus has been to safeguard the health and well-being of employees and others while also recognizing responsibility to the industry and customers.But, Nokia plans to go directly to customers with a series of 'Nokia Live' events aimed at showcasing the demos and launches scheduled for MWC.Previously, Amazon, Ericsson, Facebook, Sony, Intel, Cisco, LG and other tech companies have already withdrawn from the world's largest mobile event, pointing out the threat of the corona virus.The event is scheduled to take place in Barcelona from February 24-27. It typically draws more than 100,000 attendees and over 2,400 companies.
Trial drug for 2019 nCoV now ready to be administered to over 700 patients. 	"China’s health authorities have announced that registration for clinical trials on a potential antiviral drug for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been approved.
The antiviral drug called “Remdesivir” will be made available to the more than 700 patients that tested positive of the 2019 nCoV in Wuhan City, China for its clinical trial.
Authorities said that aside from the 2019 nCoV, the drug can also be used to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and even Ebola infection.
Remdesivir was developed by the American pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences.
China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Health Commission, and the National Medical Products Administration support the approval of the said drug. "
PH keeps ports open to all ships, even from China, despite 2019-nCoV fears . 	"All foreigners traveling from China and its two special administrative regions - Hong Kong and Macau - are currently barred from entering the Philippines amid a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 500 people in China.
A Chinese man who arrived from China's Wuhan city, where the virus emerged last year, has also died in the Philippines. First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official
Concerns about possible delays in shipments of Philippine nickel ore to China as a result of the port restrictions added to the upward pressure on nickel prices.
""As far as the ships are concerned, as far as the cargoes are concerned, we are business as usual,"" said Jay Daniel Santiago, general manager at Philippine Ports Authority, allaying worries about delays in port operations.
He said ports, particularly in capital Manila, are ""fully mechanized"" to facilitate cargo loading and unloading with minimal human intervention.
Nickel ore miners in the Philippines, a major source of the raw material for stainless steel production in China, usually resume shipments to their Chinese customers beginning March or April, after a seasonal stoppage starting the last quarter of the previous year.
""We have not yet started shipping out nickel ore, but we anticipate this virus outbreak in China would have no impact on the demand side,"" Dante Bravo, president of Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc, the Philippines' second-largest nickel ore producer and exporter, told Reuters.
""We believe this issue will be resolved soon given all the contingency measures put in place by all the parties concerned,"" he said.

Clinical Characteristics of the First 2019-nCoV Cases in Wuhan, China. 	Cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated in China, have now spread to Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and the United States. Over 557 cases of the novel virus have been confirmed as of January 23, 2020. On January 24, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a second case of 2019-nCoV in a female patient in Chicago. The patient visited Wuhan and returned to Chicago on January 13 but was not ill while traveling. Two cases of 2019-nCoV were also confirmed in France, according to reports by the Associated Press. A team of investigators from Wuhan, China, have also released an article detailing the clinical characteristics of the first 41 patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Their article, featuring information on epidemiology, laboratory, and radiology elements of the initial cases confirmed in Wuhan was published in The Lancet . According to the investigators, characteristics were determined by analyzing data from laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus via real-time polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing. Data were also obtained from forms shared by the International Severe Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. The team also communicated directly with patients and their families to collect symptom data. All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. By January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection. Symptoms The article notes that 73% of the infected patients were men and the median age of patients was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 41.0-58.0). Twenty-seven of the 41 patients were exposed to the Huanan seafood market and 1 family cluster of 2019-nCoV infection was observed. In total, 32% of patients had underlying diseases which included diabetes (8), hypertension (6), cardiovascular disease (6). Common symptoms at the onset of illness included fever (98% of cases), cough (76%), myalgia or fatigue (44%). Less common symptoms that were recorded included sputum production (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%) and diarrhea (3%). Dyspnoea developed in 55% of patients (median time for illness onset to dysponea 8.0 days [IQR: 5-13]). In 63% of the patients, lymphopenia was observed. Abnormal findings on chest CTs were observed for all 41 patients. According to the authors, complications of the infection included acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), RNAaemia (15%), acute cardiac injury (12%) and secondary infection (10%). Among the 41 patients, 13 were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 6 patients died.“Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα,” the investigators wrote. “The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.” As of January 22, 28 of 41 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Decision for discharge was based on reduction of fever for at least 10 days, and improvement of chest radiographic evidence, and viral clearance in respiratory samples from the upper respiratory tract. 
In Philippines, still no need to use face masks vs 2019-nCoV: DOH official. 	"There's still no need to use face masks in the Philippines as protection against the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.
DOH spokesperson Eric Domingo said that since there is still no confirmed 2019-nCoV case in the country, the public has no reason to use face masks as a precaution against the new virus.
""Wala naman pong circulating na (2019-nCoV) dito sa atin,"" he told radio DZMM, adding patients in the country that are being observed for suspected 2019-nCoV have a history of travel to China, where the virus began.
Domingo said he himself still doesn't wear protective outfits for the novel coronavirus.
""Nirereserve po natin yung face mask, lalo na yung N-95, sa mga health workers na nagma-manage nitong mga patients na under investigation,"" he said.
Domingo, however, recommended the use of face masks for those who are sick to help contain the spread of infectious diseases. For those who will be going to crowded places, face masks may also help prevent infections.
""'We can use face masks to protect ourselves. Ganun din kung tayo ang may sakit, 'di po dapat tayo manghawa ng iba,"" he said.
The DOH earlier said they were monitoring 23 suspected cases of the coronavirus as 4 others have already tested negative.
The Philippines remains free from the 2019-nCoV that has already claimed at least 132 lives in China and infected nearly 6,000 others.

Fertility Providers Alliance Issues Comprehensive Tool Kit Designed to Help Fertility Practices Navigate Care in a COVID-19 World. 	"As fertility practices begin to reopen their doors, the Fertility Providers Alliance (FPA), an industry organization that represents more than 450 fertility specialists, today released a comprehensive toolkit designed to help fertility practitioners navigate patient care in a COVID-19 world.
The FPA Toolkit includes sample consent forms and templates that practitioners can use to create their own screening, safety, and operating protocols. It also provides recommendations for how to prepare patients for treatment and address their pregnancy thoughts and concerns during COVID-19.
In March, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) released a set of recommendations, suggesting that fertility providers suspend all non-urgent surgeries and procedures. Since its initial recommendations, the ASRM has given fertility providers greater autonomy, affirming its trust in the physicians to consult with their patients and decide together on the best course of action during these challenging times.
Designed to be used in conjunction with other resources provided by ASRM, as well as leading national health authorities including the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FPA Toolkit is meant to serve as a practical, pragmatic tool that clinics can adopt as they begin to consider seeing new patients.
""Fertility patients undergo a tremendous amount of physical and emotional stress and this has only been compounded by the concerns and complexities of COVID-19, especially for those who've had to abruptly suspend or delay treatment,"" says Michael Alper , Medical Director & President, Boston IVF and a member of the FPA COVID-19 Task Force. ""It is our hope that, through the FPA Toolkit, we can help practitioners navigate this new world and provide our patients with compassionate care in a setting that promotes health and safety for all parties and responsibly addresses the needs and concerns of our patients.""
The FPA and fertility community are deeply committed to the safety of its patients, staff, and the families it seeks to build. The organization will continue to evaluate safety protocols as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Its goal is to promote the creation of a safe environment for the continuation of fertility care, while following guidelines for infection prevention and control and to reduce or eliminate the risk of virus transmission.
""The launch of the new FPA Toolkit is one way our organization can help practitioners continue their commitment to helping patients realize their dreams of having a family,"" says TJ Farnsworth, Founder and CEO of Inception and Founder of the FPA. ""These recommendations will bring patients closer to their ultimate goal of having a healthy a baby, while ensuring their safety, as well as the safety of physicians and staff.""
About The Fertility Providers Alliance
The Fertility Providers Alliance (FPA) represents over 450 fertility specialists who provide care to tens of thousands of patients per year in the United States . As leaders in the fertility industry, the members of the FPA have come together to reshape the delivery of fertility care. We believe the voices of the patient and the provider should be heard in all policy conversations in the field of reproductive medicine, and our collaboration across the fertility industry will promote better outcomes for all."
DeKalb CEO urges businesses to take extra COVID-19 precautions. 	"By law, DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond can’t force residents or businesses to follow coronavirus guidelines that are any more stringent than those recently outlined by Gov. Brian Kemp .
It’s well within a local leader’s purview, however, to “urge, advise, encourage and implore” folks to take additional precautions. And Thurmond did so Thursday.
In a new executive order, Thurmond repeated those five words over and over again while laying out what he hopes will be an effective pandemic “transition plan” for DeKalb County. In addition to asking residents to wear masks in public and continue following other guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thurmond’s order encouraged owners and employees of the businesses allowed to start reopening Friday — places like barber shops, nail salons and fitness centers — to take precautions beyond those recommended by the governor.
The CEO said there’s no question that Kemp’s directives supersede any local mandates.
“But he does not exempt local leaders from demonstrating leadership, and he does not exempt local leaders from encouraging folks to do the right thing and make good decisions,” Thurmond said.

Under Kemp’s order, businesses that reopen Friday — and places like restaurants and theaters that can do so Monday — must follow a series of guidelines . They include screening workers for fever and respiratory illness; enhancing workplace sanitation; maintaining proper social distancing; and wearing masks and gloves if appropriate.
In his aspirational order, Thurmond urged, advised, encouraged and implored DeKalb County businesses to go a few steps further.
The order asked business owners not only to encourage symptomatic employees to stay home, but to allow workers who have a symptomatic individual in their household to stay home as well. It also asks business owners to consider expanding paid leave policies to alleviate the economic pressure for sick employees to show up at work.
In addition, the order asked businesses to provide employees with as much personal protective equipment as possible; to encourage patrons to wear masks; and to clean and sanitize public restrooms between each use.
Some Georgia leaders were supportive of Kemp’s decision to try and start reopening the economy, which he announced Monday. Marietta’s mayor said he was going to get a haircut and hit the gym as soon as possible.
Many more, though, were skeptical . Leaders from Albany to Augusta said it was too soon — as did President Donald Trump .
Earlier in the week, Thurmond questioned Kemp’s decision to start loosening virus-related restrictions on certain businesses, saying he was praying it was the right plan but “preparing for the potential that it may have been a mistake.”
Thursday’s executive order was part of those preparations.
In addition to urging business owners and employees to take additional precautions, Thurmond asked DeKalb County houses of worship to continue sticking to remote services.
It also asked for the state to develop and implement a more robust testing and tracing program — and for the governor and others to “assist and support a rigorous investigation” of COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on communities of color. The latter, Thurmond said, should “include an analysis of the cause and underlying factors that precipitated the outbreak and steps that must be taken to prevent pandemic infections in the future.”
DeKalb County has second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Georgia. About 55% of DeKalb County’s 760,000 residents are black, and recent zip-code level data provided by the DeKalb board of health showed a significant number of coronavirus cases in predominately black areas of the county.

Cure all Corona. 	Jon's Text I am retired through a car accident, but my brain still works! I have an M.Eng, and I was doing a PhD into Global Warming, but this is only one of my interests! Do e-mail me, I like people! Hi. Doctors and Professors, talk to me. Sunday, 2 February 2020 Cure Corona totally, no pills Ultrasound—Cancer Cure: Cheap Home Cure to All Cancers Price: £13.41 (excl. VAT) Prints in 3-5 business days Ultrasound—Cancer Cure explores a perspective and revolutionary new treatment for cancer: high-intensity ultrasound, a noninvasive but promising new treatment that is being studied as a way to treat all cancers and could even cure in just one application. Author Dr. Jon Thomason shares research from the Moffitt Cancer Center, which pioneered research into this application of ultrasound, and he explains both how ultrasound works and how, more importantly, it can be used to as a treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and surgery are not the only options for patients suffering from cancer. Ultrasound is a promising new alternative that could offer a noninvasive treatment without the debilitating side-effects of radiation and surgery. Certificate of registration The US library of congress has just registered 'Ultrasound – Cheap Home Cure To All Cancers' TX 8-659-428 Add to Basket 2002 and three medical professors at the Moffitt cancer centre, published the use of High Intensity UltraSound to totally clear cancer at one session. Global doctors confirmed the same week, it works for all 200 cancers out there!They were then legally a medically constrained from ever prescribing cancer drugs again. Biochemical treatments and chemotherapy, plus radio therapy and surgery, lead inevitably to a patient's two year decline to death. And expensive agonising death.This is criminal medicine! Striking off the Dr. the first day they prescribed cancer drugs. As they were all under the legal imperative, to personally validate the Moffitt paper.They all had to acquire a HIUS device, and verified it works for all cancers. Which are forced to divide in a single cell viral fashion. Regular body cells never divide a multiply!This was actually covered in the Moffitt Paper. High us had to cure all viral infections. Major investigation revealed it also clears all bacterial infections. Which also an inflated cell structure, to induce the human immune system to copy the bacterial genome. And give it a minimal cell wall.2012 my personal contact in New York, verified ½ minute of HIUS to each side the chest totally clears he HIV AIDs. I've published my work freely on the Internet.Subsequent prescription of all AIDs medication, was medical malpractice. Striking off the Dr., Hospital, nurses, pharmacists and hospitals. So eight was totally cured 2012. 2020, medics talk as if AIDs treatments were defective medicine.They are really a 10 year biochemical death sentence. There prescription medical malpractice. He will have acquired and used a HIUS device at home. An 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound massage device, is an effective home HIUS device.Medically licensed for safe, unsupervised and home use. Clearing all AIDs in just 1 minute.So all cancers cured 2002. Subsequent cancer drug prescription striking off all involved medical staff. Who pay a fine of 10,000,000 UK pounds, for each patient medicated to death.2012 both AIDs and coronary heart disease were cleared. ½ minute of HIUS to the top left to the chest and at the back to the kidneys, clears coronary heart disease. 1 minute to the top left to the chest clears obstructive heart disease.2013 I validated ½ minute of HIUS to the bottom right of the chest over the pancreas, cleared type two diabetes. All over the world! 1 minute of HIUS clears type one diabetes instantly. Otherwise the diabetes only remits in three days, as the immune system clears the viral structure causing diabetes.2012 and we have the Corona virus. How? Every registered Dr. on earth has personally validated HIUS clears all viruses and cancers. Prescribing biochemical treatments for viruses is criminal medicine.For the doctors have a HIUS device in the nursing office. Doctors resist using it! Reasoning $50,000, two years and only 250,000 avoidable patient deaths, will lead to a biochemical treatment for a virus.Which has been totally curable totally with 1 minute of HIUS, as medically published 2002. The doctors in Wuhan China, have all validated HIUS clears all cancers. And have a suitable ultrasound device.That HIUS also clears all viruses in 1 minute! Just ½ minute to each side the chest will totally clear Corona. No Dr. Intervention required!You can buy a suitable 8 W 1 MHz device over the Internet. There and every Dr. On earth already owns the device! In a case of 8 W 3 MHZ. You can apply it freely two every patient who calls into a doctor's surgery, and he will do no harm to people without a virus. £9.90 + £2.99 P&P If they do have any virus, it will be cleared!

COVID-19 Becomes Leading Cause of Death in L.A. County. 	"""More people are dying each day from COVID-19 than from other diseases that we track and get information,"" she said. ""To put this in perspective, on average there are five people who die from flu each day during flu season. There are eight people who die from COPD (lung disease) and emphysema each day, and there are 31 people who pass away each day because of coronary heart disease. These are our leading causes of death across the county.""
With the death toll increasing rapidly in the past two weeks, Ferrer said the numbers ""are a stark reminder for all of us of the importance of slowing the spread of COVID-19,"" and the need to maintain physical-distancing and other health orders -- despite the relaxing of such rules in some jurisdictions and calls from some groups for California to follow suit.
""Across the county, the number of people in the last two months that have died from COVID-19 is greater than the number of people that died from influenza over the past eight months' flu season, and this is true for the United States as a whole as well,"" Ferrer said.
Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier Thursday that 115 people in California had died from the disease over the past 24 hours, making it the deadliest day in the state for the coronavirus.
Included in the county's more than 17,000 cases are 100 homeless people, the majority of them due to an outbreak that remains under investigation at the Union Rescue Mission on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Ferrer said the county is still awaiting some test results from the facility, but officials said earlier this week that at least 56 people had tested positive, and one staff member has died.
A total of 286 institutional settings -- including nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, shelters, jails and prisons -- have had at least one case. Those institutions have accounted for a total of 3,343 cases, and 310 deaths, representing 39% of all coronavirus fatalities in the county. The vast majority of those deaths were residents of skilled nursing facilities, where testing is being ramped up this week to include all residents and staff regardless of whether they are showing any symptoms.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Wednesday night that testing will now be offered to all front-line workers -- such as health care workers, grocery and pharmacy workers, firefighters and police officers -- regardless of whether they were symptomatic. The 30-plus testing sites across the county had previously been restricted to people who were showing some type of symptoms.
Ferrer said more than 98,000 people have been tested to date across the county, with about 14% of them testing positive. She again encouraged people to get tested if they are showing symptoms, even if they might be afraid of learning the results.
""I know many people are scared of getting their results,"" she said. ""They're worried that they won't be able to manage if they're found to be positive and need to isolate. But the county family is here to help you."" "
Texas Tech laboratory to decontaminate masks for safe reuse during COVID-19. 	"Texas Tech University ’s Biological Threat Research Laboratory, part of The Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH), has partnered with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) to decontaminate some personal protective equipment (PPE), allowing it to be reused safely.
N95 masks and other small items can be decontaminated up to 20 times, substantially extending the lifespan of these items at a time when they are so badly needed and in such short supply, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The service is extended to all health care personnel, first responders and detention centers.
The move is the latest in a series of Texas Tech-TTUHSC initiatives to increase the availability of PPE. Texas Tech faculty and staff have collected more than 137,000 items , including 3,000 N95 masks , for donation to the TTUHSC and other regional health care facilities. The West Texas 3D COVID-19 Relief Consortium , a collaborative group of faculty from Texas Tech and TTUHSC, is working to create 3D-printed face shields and face masks for health care workers as well as ventilators and ventilator components.
The Biological Threat Research Laboratory was the first laboratory in the state of Texas to conduct COVID-19 testing ."
The Corona Virus Hysteria: Liars In Media Using FAKE Pictures And Reports To Push A Criminal Agenda!. 	"I have been watching and observing the liars in the Jew spew media push their bullshit about this ""Corona Virus"" for the last week, and I do smell a rat... We have seen so many bogus reports coming out over these last few days about people ""falling over dead"" in places such as Wuhan China, and I have watched those reports and absolutely shook my head in disgust... And honestly, if people are truly that gullible and stupid that they will fall for the crap they are pushing, then there is NO hope for them at all!
In fact, I was surfing the internet since yesterday looking for some REAL TRUTHS about this ""Corona Virus"" hysteria, and I found some most interesting reports from Jim Stone's website at www.jimstone.is that I absolutely want to share with my readers.... In fact, the first part that I want to present here blows the Jew spew media lies where they are supposedly showing ""pictures"" from Wuhan China concerning this ""epidemic"" to heck... Here is that article here:
B M: I just figured out how to prove much of the pandemic story line fake If all the videos posted online to Twitter about people laying dead in the streets are real, why are a majority of them shot during the summer, with lush green leaves on the trees? China's trees don't have any leaves now. It is winter there. That means the videos are random, and no leaves on the trees does nothing to confirm the videos really are of a pandemic.
HERE WE GO! SOME, IF NOT ALL PANDEMIC RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ""FROM CHINA"" ARE PROVEN FAKE
BUSTED!!! . . . . . sometimes a ""day at work"" ends quite nicely. LOOK PEOPLE, the elite are NOT going to release a disease they can be killed by, the ""disease"" will be in the shot.
OK, I too looked at those pictures, and I thought there was something very ODD about them... Jim has hit the 'nail on the head' by showing that they could NOT have been taken recently from Wuhan as the LEAVES ON THE TREES are still there in plain sight meaning that they were actually taken MONTHS ago and well before this supposed ""outbreak""!
What we have here is therefore definitive proof that the criminals in charge are absolutely using this ""Corona Virus outbreak"" for their criminal agenda of pushing their insidious ""vaccines"" on all of us once more!
I absolutely will continue to show the evidence here that this may indeed be all a scam to get gullible people to panic and line up like dumb ass sheep to be injected by their poisonous vaccines.... So stay tuned everyone, for there is...
More to come

*Update, January 24th, 2020: Apparently I have had a few 'critics' come in and try to ruin my comment section by claiming that I do not know ""what the fuck I am talking about"" and that Wuhan, China probably does not even get snow this time of year... Well, take a look at these pictures of Wuhan in winter (courtesy once again of Jim Stone) to see for yourselves that with winter season in Wuhan, the trees are left pretty barren of leaves much like what happens here in the northern prairies in Canada:

MEK Iran: Regime Ignores Corona virus, Endangers LivesSupporters of MEK Iran. 	"The deadly coronavirus has been declared a global pandemic, with more than 31,000 confirmed cases in 28 countries and 638 deaths as of February 7th, according to the reference website worldometers.info . Governments around the world are taking precautions to fight the spread of the highly contagious airborne disease, but the Iranian regime has neglected to take even basic steps to safeguard the wellbeing of its citizens or share information about possible coronavirus infections inside Iran. A Global Response
The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China in early December, but the Chinese government kept the spread of the disease under wraps until it began to spread rapidly in January. Because of the lack of transparency, international governments have scrambled to evacuate their citizens from China and to set up quarantine protocols for those returning from areas where the virus has spread. Several countries have suspended travel to and from China except for emergency evacuations, and the United States has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all American citizens returning from Wuhan. Foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China have been temporarily barred from entering the U.S. and Australia. South Korea has temporarily banned anyone who has recently visited Wuhan from entering the country. No Precautions in Iran
On Monday 360 deaths and 17,000 cases of coronavirus had been reported worldwide. By Thursday evening, the numbers had grown to 638 deaths and more than 31,000 cases, the overwhelming majority of which were reported in mainland China. The Iranian regime is neglecting the threat to the health of the Iranian people and is not taking the necessary precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. #Iran https://t.co/YRzT5cs0bA

Concerns over the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan are so serious that residents have been ordered to stay inside their homes unless absolutely necessary. The streets in the city of 11 million people are mostly deserted, and the Chinese government has forbidden the use of personal vehicles and has closed schools and public meeting places.
Despite the severity of the situation, the Iranian regime has failed to limit flights to and from China. State-run media reported that flights continued between Iran and China on their normal schedule as of Sunday, and three flights entered Iran from Wuhan. Lack of Transparency
Mujahedin-e Khalq (PMOI/MEK Iran) sources inside Iran report that there have been cases of coronavirus in Isfahan and Tabriz, but the regime has not kept any records or shared information with the international community about infections.
On Sunday a spokesperson for Isfahan University reported that a 29-year-old patient with coronavirus-like symptoms had been admitted to Farabi Hospital in Isfahan and was “under special care.”
A few hours later the patient was released without comment or clarification. The MEK is opposed to this lack of transparency and believes that free access to information is essential to a free and democratic country. A History of Negligence
This is not the first time the regime has failed to safeguard the health of its citizens. In October 2019 hundreds of villagers in Lordegan County, Charmahal Bakhtiari Province contracted HIV after being exposed to the virus by health authorities who used improper procedures when conducting glucose tests.
— MEK Iran (Mujahedin-e Khalq) (@MEK_Iran) October 6, 2019
The villagers justifiably protested with the help of MEK Resistance Units, and instead of sending medical teams to start treatment and officials to apologize, the regime declared martial law and sent its suppressive forces to put down the rebellion.  "
Logical View of the Corona Virus, Attempt to Be Balanced. 	"For fun we’re going to use some logic as it relates to the Corona Virus in China. Instead of fear mongering, we think the USA will probably be in good shape, that said if we look at the numbers the other countries near Asia do not make sense. There is a wide range of opinions including people who think its the black plague (not even close) and people who think it should be compared to the common flu (no ability to understand statistics). We’ll attempt to put some numbers and predictions around this.
High-Level: From a top down view you can assume that it is a pretty deadly disease. Not because of the current numbers (35,000 confirmed and 725 deaths) but because of the precautions that have been taken. When the US was attacked in Baghdad they didn’t bother flying the US leaders out. Yet… We’re evacuating important people located in China. Add to this the fact that China has locked down ~400M people (at least attempting to keep it locked down) which is more than the population of the USA and Canada combined. Even during the SARS outbreak the level of restrictions was not this high.
We can make a few conclusions, the severity of the disease is 100x+ higher than any foolish comparison to the flu. You’ll get the flu at least a few times during your life and the chances of dying are in the basis points (less if you’re under the age of 60 or so). This new virus has a death rate of about 2%+ and you have to add in bodies that were found before they could be tested. Therefore an easy conclusion here is that this is a serious illness that is not currently contained. We can prove out that it is not currently contained because of the rapid growth. Therefore, conclusion number 1 is that this is a serious infection.
Current Numbers: The second item to be aware of is the growth of confirmed cases. It appears to be growing at a 10% rate or so per day. This is likely an understated number since it is reaching a point where testing this many people has a lot of errors in it . If you live in a major city, imagine trying to take 20,000 of them and test them all in a day or two. It doesn’t make a lot of sense and we know China is certainly understating the number. The more important number to track is actually the number of cases outside of Hubei. Only a few weeks ago most cases were largely contained in that particular province but now we’re looking at 25,000 people (according to the latest data) which results in 10,000 total cases outside of the primary infection point.
You can manually track places outside of Hubei with this website.
So what should you actually track? You should really track numbers in areas like Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Why? Well these countries have extremely low “cases” despite being popular areas to visit and quite close to China. It’s extremely unlikely that Singapore with 33 confirmed cases and Thailand with only 32 makes a lot of sense. There is a lot more traffic from Wuhan to Thailand. Instead if you are in Singapore you should be happy about the higher number of confirmed cases because it means your government has adequate technology to lock down and test everyone coming in. Another great example is actually Japan, while people are scared of the number of cases found on the cruise ship, you can conclude that they are taking the right measures and have adequate testing to prevent a rapid outbreak. Just take a look below.
If you look at the rough numbers from the table, why would Thailand have an equal number of cases relative to Singapore? It doesn’t make a lot of logical sense. And. The ability to simply go to Thailand is easy (without the flight data) so the chances that Thailand is behind the correct number is high. We’d wager that Thailand will end up being one of the countries with a mini outbreak at this time. The fact that Australia has half as many cases as Thailand should be another clear indicator that they are behind. And. We’ll add that Mongolia having zero cases is questionable given the close location.
Some Good News: If you’re in the USA, Europe… even Korea, Japan and Singapore, you’re pretty much good to go. The chances of having a mass outbreak in an advanced country is low. Advanced countries will be able to correctly identify the right people and increase safety for the general public. We’d be extremely surprised to see an outbreak in a major US city. Within a month or so we think the issues in Japan/Korea/Singapore will be solved /contained. The real issue appears to be in the third world countries that are located near China. The second piece of good news is that you really shouldn’t cancel any “flights” to an area outside of Asia. The virus does not live long on seats. You simply want to avoid going to China for a while and avoid the third world Asian countries as an extra precautionary measure.
Current Predictions: This wouldn’t be fun if we didn’t put out some predictions on the issue. The first one is that the total outbreak number will certainly exceed 100,000+ at some point. That is pretty likely given the spread to low-tech third world countries. The second one is that China will not solve the issue in “14 days”. We think the chances of a 14 day slow down is next to none. This likely goes on past the month of February at a minimum and into March. By the time that the issue is contained we would then add another 4-6 months before tourism goes back to normal. It is unlikely that people suddenly decide to go back to China after something this large occurs, particularly if the infected cases clears 100K.
On the positive side of things, we think this will probably peak in about a month. This means the major countries will have it contained. No major outbreaks in Singapore, USA, Europe, Australia, Japan or Taiwan. This is not going to last forever that’s for sure and we won’t be hearing about it by the end of the year (if we do it was a catastrophe). As a rough estimate we’ll go ahead and wager that the mortality/death rate will be around 2%, it seems to be stabilizing in this area and since most numbers are fudged it means 3% is more likely. This is a pretty serious issue for diseases for those that looked up mortality rates of other viruses.
Some Conclusions: The first conclusion is to certainly avoid Asia for a bit if you planned on going. If you must go certainly avoid China (for now at least). It isn’t worth the risk for a 2% death rate. The second conclusion is that panicking in the USA is a bit humorous, you’re not going to do much with a face mask. The size of the disease particles is actually smaller than the protective mask can prevent (yes we looked this all up). You might accidentally increase your chances of getting it since the particles can stick to the mask as you inhale.
If you want to be extra careful, you can reduce your travel to the regions near China as well but we’d wager that the major countries will have things under control. If you want to track it more seriously, we would look at every third world country and province outside if Hubei. That’s the major issue at this time as no one in their right mind is flying into Wuhan. Hopefully, this came out as somewhat balanced, we can’t believe the headlines that this is similar to the flu. We’ve seen too many media headlines trying to say “not a big deal” which is the exact opposite of what they did during the financial crisis. So it’s best to assume it’s worse than mainstream media, worse than Chinese media and *better* than hysteria in the USA/abroad. The face mask business in the USA is booming for no reason (if you’re in the face mask business congrats on the extra sales!)
Yes our Q&A will take place tomorrow for product purchasers only thanks!"

The basic structure of the latest coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the same as that of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which broke out in China in 2003. Like the SARS virus, 2019-nCoV has been found to share the same receptor , Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Some suspect that these two viruses have been deliberately weaponized, due to a finding that Asian males have five times as many ACE2-expressing cells in their lungs as any other demographic. This line of inquiry is being shut down on public chatboards for being “discriminatory”, which is absurd. This echoes complaints shared by Chinese Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai on Face the Nation this past Sunday of “racial discrimination” and “xenophobic” comments (like “bat soup”). He warned that online discussion of the topic was “dangerous”, for fear of causing “mass-panic”. The 50-Cent Army has succeeded in shutting down related threads on Reddit and elsewhere. Another feature of 2019-nCoV that has raised suspicions of weaponization was described in a study from India submitted for peer review, that the same amino acid “insertions” in the spike glycoprotein as seen in the HIV-1 virus were present in 2019-nCoV but are not present in other coronaviruses. The study stated that these “insertions” are “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”. The paper was hastily withdrawn by its authors, due to pressure, likely from the Chinese government. In AIDS patients, these spike glycoproteins drop off the virus and plug into receptors on the intestinal wall, blocking the absorption of nutrients and causing the dramatic physical wasting that is a hallmark of AIDS.Bioweapons expert, Dr. Francis Boyle is shown in this video saying, “SARS, itself is already a biological warfare weapon and then they… supercharged it…with DNA, genetic engineering of maybe synthetic biology to add in to SARS, HIV…they gave it these gain-of-function activities.”The videos coming out of China are harrowing. People are being violently dragged away from their homes, to be taken to quarantine facilities. Alternately, the doors to apartment complexes are being welded shut, to prevent residents from exiting the buildings and spreading the disease.Philippines Senate President, Tito Sotto showed a video suggesting that 2019-nCoV was a product of Bill Gates and the CIA. Many truthers have published similar stories; that the Pirbright Institute in the UK owns the 2019-nCoV patent and that Bill Gates is involved.In response, a spokesperson for Pirbright, Teresa Maughan said that “not only does the patent in question not involve a coronavirus strain that affects humans, but the institute’s work with the virus wasn’t funded by the Gates Foundation.”The Pirbright Institute owns the patents for several coronaviruses that affect poultry and pigs. The CDC owns the patent for SARS, having sequenced the genome in 2003, at the time of the outbreak.On January 24th, the Institut Pasteur in France announced that it had sequenced the genome of 2019-nCoV, which matched the one shared with them by Chinese authorities on January 11th. Presumably, the novel coronavirus will be patented by the Chinese.

Abstract A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development. Severe infection by 2019-nCov could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 15% of infected individuals 1 , 2 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of this virus can associate with the surface receptors of sensitive cells, which mediated the entrance of the virus into target cells for further replication. Recently, Xu et.al., modeled the spike protein to identify the receptor for 2019-nCov, and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this virus 3 . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63 4 – 6 . According to their modeling, although the binding strength between 2019-nCov and ACE2 is weaker than that between SARS-Cov and ACE2, it is still much higher than the threshold required for virus infection. Zhou et. al. conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 7 . These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCov. The expression and distribution of the receptor decide the route of virus infection and the route of infection has a major implication for understanding the pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies. Previous studies have investigated the RNA expression of ACE2 in 72 human tissues 8 . However, the lung is a complex organ with multiple types of cells, and such real-time PCR RNA profiling is based on bulk tissue analysis with no way to elucidate the ACE2 expression in each type of cell in the human lung. The ACE2 protein level is also investigated by immunostaining in lung and other organs 8 , 9 . These studies showed that in normal human lung, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells. Endothelial cells were also reported to be ACE2 positive. However, immunostaining analysis is known for its lack of signal specificity, and accurate quantification is also another challenge for such analysis. The recently developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology enables us to study the ACE2 expression in each cell type and give quantitative information at single-cell resolution. Previous work has built up the online database for scRNA-Seq analysis of 8 normal human lung transplant donors 10 . In current work, we used the updated bioinformatics tools to analyze the data. In total, we analyzed 43,134 cells derived from normal lung tissue of 8 adult donors. We performed unsupervised graph-based clustering (Seurat version 2.3.4) and for each individual, we identified 8~11 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters based on their marker gene expression profile. Typically the clusters include type II alveolar cells (AT2), type I alveolar cells (AT1), airway epithelial cells (ciliated cells and Club cells), fibroblasts, endothelial cells and various types of immune cells. The cell cluster map of a representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old) was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) as shown in Fig. 1b and his major cell type marker expressions were demonstrated in Fig.2 .

Next, we analyzed the cell-type-specific expression pattern of ACE2 in each individual. For all donors, ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells. The majority of the ACE2-expressing cells (averagely 83%) are AT2 cells. Averagely 1.4±0.4% of AT2 cells expressed ACE2. Other ACE2 expressing cells include AT1 cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. However, their ACE2-expressing cell ratio is low and variable among individuals. For the representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old), the expressions of ACE2 and cell-type-specific markers in each cluster are demonstrated in Fig.2 . To further understand the special population of ACE2-expressing AT2, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to study which biological processes are involved with this cell population by comparing them with the AT2 cells not expressing ACE2. Surprisingly, we found that multiple viral process-related GO are significantly over-presented, including “positive regulation of viral process” (P value=0.001), “viral life cycle” (P value=0.005), “virion assembly” (P value=0.03) and “positive regulation of viral genome replication” (P value=0.04). These highly expressed viral process-related genes in ACE2-expressing AT2 include: SLC1A5, CXADR, CAV2, NUP98, CTBP2, GSN,HSPA1B,STOM, RAB1B, HACD3, ITGB6, IST1,NUCKS1,TRIM27, APOE, SMARCB1,UBP1,CHMP1A,NUP160,HSPA8,DAG1,STAU1,ICAM1,CHMP5,D EK, VPS37B, EGFR, CCNK, PPIA, IFITM3, PPIB, TMPRSS2, UBC, LAMP1 and CHMP3. Therefore, it seems that the 2019-nCov has cleverly evolved to hijack this population of AT2 cells for its reproduction and transmission. We further compared the characteristics of the donors and their ACE2 expressing patterns. No association was detected between the ACE2-expressing cell number and the age or smoking status of donors. Of note, the 2 male donors have a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than all other 6 female donors (1.66% vs. 0.41% of all cells, P value=0.07, Mann Whitney Test). In addition, the distribution of ACE2 is also more widespread in male donors than females: at least 5 different types of cells in male lung express this receptor, while only 2~4 types of cells in female lung express the receptor. This result is highly consistent with the epidemic investigation showing that most of the confirmed 2019-nCov infected patients were men (30 vs. 11, by Jan 2, 2020). We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area. Altogether, in the current study, we report the RNA expression profile of ACE2 in the human lung at single-cell resolution. Our analysis suggested that the expression of ACE2 is concentrated in a special population of AT2 which expresses many other genes favoring the viral process. This conclusion is different from the previous report which observed abundant ACE2 not only in AT2, but also in endothelial cells 8 . In fact, to our knowledge, endothelial cells sometimes can be non-specifically stained in immunohistochemical analysis. The abundant expression of ACE2 in a population of AT2 explained the severe alveolar damage after infection. The demonstration of the distinct number and distribution of ACE2-expressing cell population in different cohorts can potentially identify the susceptible population. The shortcoming of the study is the small donor sample number, and that the current technique can only analyze the RNA level but not the protein level of single cells. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether there is any other co-receptor responsible for the 2019-nCov infection, which might also help to explain the observed difference of transmission ability between SARS-Cov and 2019-nCov. Future work on the ACE2 receptor profiling could lead to novel anti-infective strategies such as ACE2 protein blockade or ACE2-expressing cell ablation. Methods Public datasets (GEO: GSE122960) were used for bioinformatics analysis. Firstly, we used Seurat (version 2.3.4) to read a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples. We removed the low-quality cells with less than 200 or more than 6,000 detected genes, or if their mitochondrial gene content was > 10%. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than 3 cells. For normalization, the combined gene-barcode matrix was scaled by total UMI counts, multiplied by 10,000 and transformed to log space. The highly variable genes were identified using the function FindVariableGenes. Variants arising from number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out by specifying the vars.to.regress argument in Seurat function ScaleData. The expression level of highly variable genes in the cells was scaled and centered along each gene, and was conducted to principal component analysis. Then we assessed the number of PCs to be included in downstream analysis by (1) plotting the cumulative standard deviations accounted for each PC using the function PCElbowPlot in Seurat to identify the ‘knee’ point at a PC number after which successive PCs explain diminishing degrees of variance, and (2) by exploring primary sources of heterogeneity in the datasets using the PCHeatmap function in Seurat. Based on these two methods, we selected the first top significant PCs for two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), implemented by the Seurat software with the default parameters. We used FindClusters in Seurat to identify cell clusters for each sample. Following clustering and visualization with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), initial clusters were subjected to inspection and merging based on the similarity of marker genes and a function for measuring phylogenetic identity using BuildClusterTree in Seurat. Identification of cell clusters was performed on the final aligned object guided by marker genes. To identify the marker genes, differential expression analysis was performed by the function FindAllMarkers in Seurat with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differentially expressed genes that were expressed at least in 25% cells within the cluster and with a fold change more than 0.25 (log scale) were considered to be marker genes. tSNE plots and violin plots were generated using Seurat.

NTS Notes: When I first read this report, and after I read it over again a second time, I thought to myself: A ""race and gender specific"" virus? It may lead to the false assumption that this was indeed a ""man made"" disease in that laboratory in Wuhan China for biological weapons research, but after carefully looking at the article again, I can say that the researchers who wrote this piece do know their stuff and that they are stating that the fact that Asian people, specifically Asian MEN, have a different make up of Alveolar AT2 cells in their lungs due to natural DNA and RNA make up of their lungs, and that this Wuhan Coronavirus apparently more readily attaches itself to that SPECIFIC makeup.... All this means is that the present Wuhan Coronavirus may indeed be targeting Asian MALES specifically! Nothing artificial therefore to be assumed here at all....
It is therefore no wonder that this ""Coronavirus"" is more predominant in China, as it is naturally attracted to lung tissue where it can multiply But hey, this is fact and not fiction here, and try telling this to the criminals in the Jew spew media and even those in the alternative media that are screaming that the ""sky is falling""....
Honestly, I do love these scientific reports, for they are RIGHT UP MY ALLEY, and something that brings me back to my University days as a pupil of science I did some dabbling decades ago in Biology as well as my major in Physics, so I find reports like this one to be so refreshing
I can guarantee one thing, though... There will be those out there that will now scream ""Racism"" after reading this report, as well as claiming that this virus is indeed ""bio-engineered"" due to the fact that it apparently will hit only once certain race of humans... BUT in spite of that ignorance, this is fact and not fiction, and shows once again that we as humans are indeed different in a lot of ways in regards to race, including how we are affected by certain diseases!
More to come

Stanford Medicine Tests Anti-Viral Drug for Covid-19. 	"With no approved treatments for COVID-19, Stanford Medicine has joined large-scale clinical trials to determine if remdesivir, an experimental anti-viral medication, works.
In early March, when patients with the coronavirus started arriving at Stanford Hospital, a team of infectious disease researchers at the university put their heads together and made a quick decision. Among the potential treatments for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus, their first choice to investigate was the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir. They jumped right in.
Within a week, Stanford Medicine had joined a number of other medical centers around the world in global trials sponsored by Gilead Sciences Inc. , the maker of the drug, which is not yet approved as a treatment for COVID-19. By the end of March, the infectious disease doctors had enrolled 30 participants in two trials - one for severe and the other for moderately ill patients - who were receiving the drug intravenously. In addition, another group of Stanford scientists began enrolling participants in a similar, large-scale clinical trial of remdesivir, this one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.
""We brought this on fast,"" said Aruna Subramanian , MD, clinical professor of infectious disease and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trials at Stanford. ""We got everything together in a week and were ready to roll. This was record time. This type of thing normally takes two to three months to get on board."" Worldwide push
During normal times, a phase 3 clinical trial - the final step in the process of drug approval - typically takes months of planning, after years of research, before it’s underway. But these aren’t normal times. With a fast-moving pandemic bearing down and no approved treatments available, researchers are, like everyone else, desperate for answers, and they have ramped up their efforts to find solutions. Remdesivir jumped to the top of the list of potential treatments in part because it was farthest along in the approval process, Subramanian said. By the end of February, as the virus spread in the United States, there were at least five clinical trials of remdesivir underway. China initiated the first two studies in February, followed later that month by the Gilead trials for severe and moderate patients and the NIH trial. By the end of March, Gilead had expanded to 100 testing sites both in the United States and abroad, and the NIH trial had expanded to 60 sites, 50 of those in the United States.
Gilead recently reported that it is expecting to have preliminary data from the study of severe patients by the end of April. The two studies in China, though, were halted due to lack of patients. ""We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,"" said Anthony Fauci , MD, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , in a press release announcing the start of the NIH’s remdesivir trial. ""A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients."" That same month, while speaking about the coronavirus, Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization announced, ""There’s only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy, and that’s remdesivir."" Why remdesivir
There are multiple reasons for remdesivir’s current reputation as a potential treatment for COVID-19, among them the anecdotal stories that have appeared in the media. While the drug is not commercially available, it is being used to treat patients with COVID-19 through a compassionate care program on a case-by-case basis, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. In late January, reports out of Washington State that the first person in the nation diagnosed with COVID-19 had been treated with remdesivir, and recovered, made headlines. But scientists are quick to warn against basing treatment guidelines on anecdotal evidence and reports in the news media.
""We have had patients hospitalized at Stanford who got remdesivir under compassionate care guidelines,"" said Stanley Deresinski , MD, associate chief of the division of infectious diseases at Stanford. ""Some got better. Some got worse. At this point, we just don’t know. We hope to have results soon for remdesivir, and by then we should have another trial in the works for the next best thing.""
At Stanford, the team of infectious disease scientists running the Gilead trials say that, like other scientists, they picked remdesivir as their first choice based on promising results from years of lab and animal research. Often referred to as the Ebola drug, remdesivir was also previously tested in a clinical trial for treating that disease. It failed to show that it was effective for Ebola in comparison with two other drugs, but based on the study, it’s generally known to be safe in humans, said Philip Grant , MD, assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trial.
For years, remdesivir has shown potential in cell cultures and animals infected by other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, said Robert Shafer , MD, professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, whose lab recently created a coronavirus anti-viral research database. ""Remdesivir looks very good in the lab. In cell cultures, it’s also been more active in fighting the coronavirus than other drugs. That’s why I think it’s promising. I’m looking forward to seeing what the clinical trials show."" The science
A coronavirus infection occurs when the germ enters the body’s airways through the nose, mouth or eyes, then lodges in the cells in the lining of the lung’s airways, where it quickly starts to make millions of copies of itself, wreaking havoc on the lungs, Subramanian said.
The virus makes copies of itself by inserting its own genes into the human cell’s genetic machinery, basically hijacking the replication process of the human cell. Remdesivir, like other anti-virals, is designed to target the system the virus uses to replicate, acting as a cap that prevents the virus from making new copies of itself or infecting other cells. Whether this works in people to reduce symptoms of COVID-19 or shorten the length of the disease is not known yet.
""We need the data, the scientific rigor of doing randomized clinical trials,"" said Robert Harrington , MD, the Arthur L. Bloomfield Professor in Medicine and chair of the department of medicine at Stanford. ""That’s how clinical science and patient care advances. We can’t depend on anecdotal stories in order to practice the best clinical medicine. We have to wait for the science."" Other potential treatments
But scientists around the world aren’t standing still, waiting for the results of remdesivir trials. All kinds of studies are moving ahead at breakneck speed to find the next best treatment or vaccine for the disease.
""A variety of drugs have been suggested,"" Deresinski said. ""Hydroxychloroquine has been known for 50 years to have nonspecific anti-viral properties. But for now, remdesivir is our preferred agent.""
The anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also have made headlines as potential treatments for COVID-19. The drugs are currently used off-label in certain cases to treat the disease. But with only a few anecdotal studies showing benefits, they have not received approval from the FDA for COVID-19. Reports have warned of dangerous side effects that need to be studied before widespread use. Recently, a small study of chloroquine in Brazil was halted for safety reasons due to high doses causing irregular heart rhythms. ""Chloroquine is being used a little bit too widely without proper study,"" Subramanian said, adding that there’s also a growing concern that stockpiling and hoarding of the drugs are limiting supplies for people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis who are prescribed the medication. ""We prefer to be data-driven as much as possible.""
The next step for FDA approval of these anti-malarial drugs to treat - or prevent - COVID-19 depends on data-driven evidence from similar large-scale clinical trials, some of which are currently in the planning process. Whether chloroquine is Stanford’s next best guess for potential treatment, though, is still up for debate.
""Ours is an adaptive trial, which means that if remdesivir doesn’t work, we can quickly move on to testing the next, most promising drug without any gap in time,"" said Neera Ahuja , MD, principal investigator of the NIH-sponsored remdesivir trial at Stanford and chief of the division of hospital medicine. She is working with Kari Nadeau , MD, PhD, professor of medicine and of pediatrics, and others on the trial, which includes participants recruited at Stanford Health Care - ValleyCare.
""We’re hopeful about remdesivir, but we are already planning for what the next drug might be,"" Ahuja said. ""We want patients to get any possible treatments that might benefit them as soon as possible.""
Stanford Medicine integrates research, medical education and health care at its three institutions - Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford Health Care (formerly Stanford Hospital & Clinics) , and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford. "
Gloria Ramsbottom-Lemieux : The 1st Lady of HR: Corona and well being. 	"I am the First Lady of HR with a stellar career. ""People"" is my middle name, on Tuesdays. ""Save a dollar, save a dime, spending cash is a corporate crime"" Friday, 14 February 2020 Corona and well being Wellness and Revenue Following a stay in hospital for a discrete illness and the Corona virus, CEO Stan has shown an enhanced interest in health. He measures his blood pressure twice an hour and has asked his private chef (K Ray Beauregard-Goldstein who has mixed ethnicity) for foods which are ""softer on my gut"". Stan also washes his hands when he leaves the bathroom and does not shake anyone’s hands. Stan also said at a recent staff meeting that ""a nations' health is a nations' wealth"" which was the motto of the Montreal Star which my dear Dad Pierre Elliot Ramsbottom used to read on the weekends. Today after a day “that didn’t start well”, CEO Stan flip flopped on Corona, like a French socialist who needs to balance a budget. Stan texted me at 1255 pm: ""Gloria, how are we dealing with Corona scare? Keep the health of our firm in mind. No travel to anywhere that compromises my and our well being."" At 1 pm, I got a copy of an email message from R&D chief Comrade Carl Marks which read: ""I know a government hack in Indonesia who rates our new product as a “pearl”. He studied with me in Mother Russia. The only problem is our travel policy which does not allow me to travel to Jakarta for a demo; travel policy defines Indonesia as a dangerous travel zone, like Damascus, Jerusalem and Detroit.""

CEO Stan asked Hugh ""to what extent is all this Corona crap racist shit, White?"" White coughed at looked at me for direction, in line with my core value of obedience. I signalled to White proceed. ""Mister Stan, Corona appears to me to be rating-related and racist-based scare tactics, yet at the same time, Indonesia is not somewhere I suggest travelling to at the moment, Sir. However I do think that Indonesian cuisine is very unique."" Stan looked at White and said nothing; White became whiter. Stan blurted out that he agrees that Corona is a racist scare tactic, and that all staff flying Indonesia “should travel Economy Plus to stretch their legs. Gloria, revise travel policy within 90 seconds to align HR with our core values of Revenue First”. Stan mentioned that he does not plan to visit Indonesia for the time being, but to show solidarity with Carl and the sales folks heading off to Jakarta, ""I do not plan to take a Corona shot. Corona is a racial slur.” I had forgotten to tell Stan that there is no shot for Corona. My Dad Pierre Elliot used to say that ""Americans use the term racial slur liberally, Glo. Take it with a pinch of salt"". I have a friend in Indonesia."

President backs Go’s Balik-Probinsya program. 	"President Rodrigo Duterte is backing the “Balik-Probinsya” proposal of Senator Christopher “Bong” Go’ for the government to provide incentives and livelihood assistance to those in Metro Manila who may want to go back to their provinces once the community quarantine is lifted.
During a televised meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases on Friday, the President lauded the proposal which Go himself delivered during the meeting.
“What you would give them is hope. Importante yan e — yung that if they go there some of them might really leave the city of Manila with a heavy heart but we have to provide the transportation at sabihin natin if you go back ganito ganito.”
“What is really very important is we give them hope,” the President said.
Go’s proposal aims to decongest Metro Manila as he said that the lack of urban planning and rural development is one of the factors why COVID-19 cases is spreading fast in the capital.
“As soon as the ECQ is lifted and travel is gradually normalize, the government must encourage Filipino families to move out of Manila and other metropolitan areas.”
“LGUs (Local Government Units) must also ensure that necessary quarantine measures and mass testing for COVID-19 are in place to prevent those possibly infected from spreading the disease,” Go said.
Under Go’s proposal, the government will shoulder the transportation of families who would want to be relocated to provinces. They should also be livelihood assistance.
The Senator, who is from Mindanao believes the implementation of the program would result to a more efficient delivery of public goods and services that can benefit all regions.
Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez also expressed his support to the program. He suggested that the government provide starting fund for those who would want to start small businesses outside of Metro Manila."
Twinbrook ‘pausing’ COVID-19 plan after criticism. 	"Apr 24, 2020 at 4:31 PM Nursing home faced backlash after announcing it would move residents and treat COVID-19 patients.
The plan to convert a Lawrence Park Township nursing home into a COVID-19 recovery unit has been put on hold a day after the facility’s parent company faced questions from staff and local officials.
The company, Guardian Elder Care, said Friday afternoon that it was ""pausing"" the process, which would have uprooted nearly 100 residents at its Twinbrook Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center.
""Based upon the most current assessment of COVID-19 cases in northwest Pennsylvania, we are pausing implementation of Twinbrook for this particular use,"" Guardian told the Erie Times-News through a spokesman, Jeremy Church.
""Should a significant increase in cases arise or a ‘second wave’ occur, Guardian is ready to transition this site to a COVID-19 recovery unit if it serves the best interests of the local community,"" the statement said.
The company’s about-face came a day after the Erie Times-News raised questions about who had asked Guardian to designate Twinbrook as a COVID-19 recovery unit.
Guardian said repeatedly that Twinbrook had been ""asked to establish"" a designated unit for COVID-19 patients, but refused to answer questions about who had made the request.
When the Erie Times-News asked local hospitals and the state Department of Health, all said they did not ask Guardian to take the unusual step of converting a nursing home into a recovery center for patients with the virus.
Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the department has not asked any nursing homes in Pennsylvania to act as COVID-19 units.
""The state is working through plans for alternate care sites for areas seeing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, which Erie is not,"" Wardle said in an email. ""The use of nursing homes or long-term care facilities for these purposes, or as designated recovery units, is not under consideration.""
Saint Vincent Hospital did not contact Guardian about establishing such a unit, spokeswoman Monica Lewis said.
A spokeswoman for UPMC Hamot said the hospital had surveyed local nursing homes to determine options for housing COVID-19 patients who might need continued treatment in a long-term care facility.
UPMC Hamot did not ask Guardian to designate a COVID-19 unit at Twinbrook, said the spokeswoman, Karen Beardsley.
""Guardian actually presented to us their plan to recreate Twinbrook and offer it as an additional community resource to treat COVID-19 patients,"" she said.
The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine also did not ask Guardian to create a COVID-19 recovery unit.
Jaime Babiak, the director of operations at the LECOM Senior Living Center, said through a spokeswoman that Guardian contacted LECOM Health to ask questions about the LECOM Nursing and Rehabilitation Center’s new unit, which was set up to accept possible COVID-19 positive patients.
""LECOM Health was not part of their decision-making process,"" Babiak said.
When asked about the denials, Guardian appeared to back off the claim that it had been asked to establish a COVID-19 recovery unit.
In Friday’s statement, Guardian said:
""In recent weeks, we had extensive conversations with physicians and executives at acute care health systems across the region, state and in Erie, along with the state department of health.
""These discussions and guidance from CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) have concluded a best practice is the establishment of dedicated COVID-19 recovery units or sites at specific skilled nursing facilities that have the resources to care for patients transitioning out of the acute care phase in hospitals.""
The Twinbrook announcement on Wednesday, about converting the facility to a unit for COVID-19 patients, surprised staff, residents and local officials.
It came just two weeks after State Rep. Pat Harkins, of Erie, D-1st Dist., called for a state investigation into conditions at the nursing home.
Harkins said he has received numerous complaints from residents’ family members and Twinbrook staff about shortages in basic supplies and other problems.
He said Thursday that he would fight ""tooth and nail"" to prevent Twinbrook from being designated a COVID-19 recovery unit.
The nursing home also performed poorly on a patient care inspection conducted by the state Department of Health in January.
Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper has also expressed concerns about the Twinbrook plan. At her daily news conference on COVID-19 on Friday, Dahlkemper said she is working with Harkins and the state Department of Health on ""rectifying the situation.""
""From everything that we’ve been able to deduce, there is not a need in Erie County for more skilled nursing beds for COVID-19-positive patients,"" Dahlkemper said. ""If we don’t have a need, I would prefer that more of those beds not be created.
""Certainly I would very much prefer that no one be brought into Erie County who is COVID-19 positive and isn’t a current resident of our community."""
Experts suggest ventilation, not isolation is the key to curb Corona. 	"The Coronavirus epidemic for the first time registered a victim count less than 3000 on Monday. On Monday evening the reported newly infected were 2,097 as per Chinese authority. The virus was capable of finding more than 3000 new hosts every day till now in China.
As a matter of increased concern, a few cases from Europe were reported were in no travel history to China or the disease affected areas were found in patients’ passport. In the United Kingdom, a total of eight cases are confirmed. This has pushed the government to issue a warning that the outbreak of novel coronavirus was a ‘serious and imminent threat’.
With experts working round the clock to find a cure to the novel coronavirus, one study says that staying at well-ventilated areas can save you from catching the viral infection. The abundant fresh air makes us far less susceptible to contract the virus through breath and infected surface contact. This is, of course, in addition to other precautionary methods like washing hands, staying away from crowded places, avoiding infected people and wearing protective masks when visiting sick friends and relatives.
Researchers have also said that making a switch to fans from air-conditioners will also help to a great extent. You can also open the doors and windows of your home to let in the fresh air. Even the World Health Organisation says that suspected patients of coronavirus should be kept in rooms that are well-ventilated."
Corona virus and pentagon Quarantine help? Communist infiltration in the Government!. 	"Here is the technique we use to heal unseen negative influences. You can use them on others because these negative influences are already trespassing and you are only affirming one’s divinity, not influencing them for personal gain. You can call on the House of Mary, Jesus, Baba ji, Buddha, your own main teacher and guide if you know it, yet it is best to use fifth dimensional beings on up beyond the astral level. They are ascended and off the wheel of life.
In dealing with the darkest of the unseen negative influences, call on the 7th dimensional Lion beings. They seem to be the only ones to really take care of business with this group. Maahes, Narasimha, Bacal, Caja, Sekhmet are a few of them known in history. The ancient Egyptians were fully aware of the archons as depicted in their wall paintings and how to deal with them.
Healing Technique: Healing is a must for all those who desire to operate in other realms of consciousness. You must have self – authority and maintain control. If you are experiencing negative vibrations, they are either thought forms, limiting mental concepts, psychic bonds or discarnate entities (lost souls) in need of healing. They are bound to the earth vibration due to lower vibrational attitudes and emotions. Some are coercive and desire to manipulate or control. Love heals. Casting out only sends them to another place, another person. IN all healings, remember that god is love. It is the power of love that heals and lifts. We will give you the following steps to clear the energy.
1. Close your aura by visualizing a white or gold light around you.
2. Call upon your chosen cultural representative of God, be it Jesus, Buddha, Babaji, Mary, Mohammed, White Eagle or another one of the beautiful Many Christed Ones.
3. Tell the entities they are healed and forgiven, lifted and enlightened. (repeat if you feel it is needed)
4. Tell them that they are filled and surrounded with the Christ light and the Christ love (or the highest consciousness and energy available).
5. Ask that your chosen representative to take them to their perfect place and highest expression.
6. Ask that all negative thought forms and limiting mental concepts be dissolved and lifted into the light of truth.
7. Ask that all psychic bonds be severed, and close their auras to all but spirit of the highest vibration.
Repeat this process until you feel clear. There may be more than one healing to do. Remember that your word is very powerful, and what is spoken on their level manifests instantly. Many enlightened ones use this process before opening. It creates a clear and safe environment and it also lifts the one who is doing the healing. Intent is nine-tenths of the law!
Hope this helps, please share with your family and friends.

What is the purpose of your updates? What do they actually do for us and why are there so many of them? The purpose of the updates is to inform, to activate, to empower, to uplift, to inspire and to bridge. Yes, some people are activated by reading my channeled updates and books. The actual activation process is a very subtle one that involves the slight lifting of your spiritual amnesia. Activation takes place through the use of various combinations and sequences of words on each page of either my updates or my books. They contain a specific vibration pattern that sets up a resonance in your suppressed RNA/DNA memory. This vibration pattern then gradually helps to activate your remembrance of those past events and/or universal truths that are embedded in your cellular memory. You have suppressed them since childhood. When the time or circumstances are right, these profound memories begin to make their appearance once again. I am very fortunate to be one of those persons who has been given the gift to activate people in this wonderful manner. There are many updates, actually weekly, to let people know that there is an ongoing educational and activational process. This process requires that a constant series of updates be given to the public. The primary purposes of this mission are to inform you of what is happening and to aid the Galactic Federation in preparing you for the eventuality of first contact. 2. Why do you believe that when the first contact comes, the people will be ready and accepting, rather than suspicious and rebellious? We can break this response into two parts. First, the entire process for our first contact is being orchestrated by the Spiritual Hierarchy. They have arranged for contact to occur only in the right divine time. This time will happen when our population is sufficiently prepared spiritually and has an awareness in the necessary proportions for the divine contact. This preparation is now occurring in the present period. Those people who are now awakening are going through a preparation that will quickly rid them of much of the potential negative reaction to first contact. Also, the first contact will introduce our planet on a large scale to the incredible positive energies of the Spiritual Hierarchy. The first contact is a return to our spiritual home and an acceptance of who we truly are. That is, we are awakening physical Angels who will assist the Spiritual Hierarchy in the unfolding of Creation in the Physical Universe. Second, the first contact is being undertaken to end your galactic quarantine. It is a time to end the spiritual amnesia that has gripped most of you since early childhood. When this process is complete, you will remember all that you have now forgotten. Most of all, you will remember the nature of the soul contract that you agreed to before you incarnated on planet Earth. In this holy soul contract, we gave the Spiritual Hierarchy our permission to ask for a divine intervention. This procedure meets one of the major criteria for first contact and assures the Galactic Federation of our full cooperation in this matter. This contact is not a rescue mission. Rather, it is a return to the inter-dimensional realities from whence we came and to which we daily long to return. This process of remembrance permits us to overcome any resistance or negativity that our limited mental constructs will be able to put into our heads. 3. In your book and lectures, you mention that Earth will be a showcase planet. What do you mean by a “showcase” planet”? From her beginnings, Mother Earth has been blessed with a great prophetic destiny. This divine destiny, as prophesied by the Archangels, was that Earth would one day have a great galactic civilization upon it. This future galactic society would be the divine one that would bring an end to the galactic wars and establish permanent galactic peace and unity. This galactic society would be composed of the souls of many great Beings from all over the Milky Way Galaxy. They would come together and pass through the final stages of a grand genetic experiment. Their success would mark the rise of a new era in our galaxy. Planet Earth and this solar system are therefore destined to become the meeting place for the entire galaxy. Earth galactic society would become the finest example of how galactic civilization serves the divine laws of the Creator. Mother Earth and her sacred children would teach many of the other star nations about how best to apply the divine laws of the Universe. Earth would become a great meeting place and trade center for the exchange of all forms of innovative goods. It is for these reasons that it will truly become a “showcase” planet. 4. Who are the Council of Nine? The Council of the Nine are the major representatives of the Great Blue Lodge of the Great Blue Light. This Great Blue Light of Creation comes directly from Lord Siraya. It first passes through the Council of the Nine and from there is distributed to the High Light Councils of Oryon. From there, it passes through all the Great Sacred Councils of Archangels, Angels, Elohim and Time Lords (the lineage of Heaven) that exist in all of Creation. In their divine Beingness, the Council of Nine carries the mighty sacred energies of the holy WILL of Lord Siraya, a major aspect of the Supreme Creator. The Great Blue Lodge is composed of the holy places in which the sacred Blue Light of Divine Creation is illuminated to every part of Creation. In the case of the Milky Way Galaxy, the spot for the anchoring of this holy and divine Light is the Sirius star system. It is here in the Sirius B solar system that the great Oracle Temple of the Council of Nine, and of Lord Siraya, is located. It is Earth’s magnificent destiny to join the Sirius star system in the coming galactic year of 8 Eb (2013 AD) and to have a corresponding Great Oracle Temple of Lord Siraya and the Great Blue Light built there. The Council of Nine are Lord Siraya’s most profound messengers. They carry Lord Siraya’s divine Light to all of Creation. In his name, they proclaim the mighty WILL of the Creator to all Beings. It is their holy task to see that every Creation unfolds as provided for by the Divine Plan. Through their wise and profound council, the sacred knowledge of every Creation is revealed to all concerned. All of the divine lineage of Heaven is beholden to the Great Council of the Nine. 5. What is the photon belt and what has happened to it? The main photon belt is an immense inter-dimensional belt of Light energy. It has the shape of a huge torroid that is almost 26,000 years in diameter. This belt has greatly affected our planet and our solar system on a regular basis. Usually, it takes about 2,000 years for us to move through one of the doughnut-shaped parts of this huge cosmic torroid. Currently, we are imbedded in a huge hole torn through it by another smaller photon belt. This rip in one of the doughnut-shaped parts of the photon belt is much larger than the entire diameter of Earth’s solar system. Only hours before our solar system encountered the main photon belt's null zone, the smaller photon belt, or gamma rich bow wave from the great nova of 1987, created an enormous hole in the main photon belt. During the course of this collision between the two photon belts, the smaller belt’s life-threatening gamma ray energies were greatly diminished, and those remaining were totally dissipated by their subsequent encounter with the planets Saturn and Jupiter. At the appropriate time, we will briefly enter the main photon belt and then join the Sirius star system. 6. Have our rituals and meditations actually changed the scenario for the Earth Changes so that they will not be so cataclysmic? If the changes are going to be gentler, will this change the Federation’s plans to evacuate some of the Earth’s population? Yes, your marvelous spiritual work has greatly assisted the local Spiritual Hierarchy in changing both the timing and the intensity of the Earth Changes. However, there will still be Earth Changes. Your beloved planet must change the nature and energy of its current surface topography and return to a pristine state. What you have done is to give your planet’s population the additional time to shift and to awaken. This marvelous reality is a most wonderful gift that you have given to your fellow humans and to your local Spiritual Hierarchy. At present, the Galactic Federation’s plans have not changed for a physical evacuation of some elements of your planet’s population in the near future. What have changed are some aspects of the entire evacuation scenario. This evacuation scenario is now seen as a significant way to introduce the Galactic Federation of Light to the entire human population of planet Earth. What have changed are only the intensity and the timing of these drastic Earth Changes. 7. Some PAG members live quite far apart and weekly meetings are not very convenient. Can we conduct PAG business without actually meeting physically? The answer to that question is yes. The key is to inform each PAG member of what is occurring and the progress of your various projects. Your feedback can come via the telephone (conference calls), by online continuous e-mail transactions, by transmitting of progress reports and immediate replies, or even by a bi-weekly meeting with members of the PAGs. What is important is that there be a constant and creative exchange of information among PAG members. Hopefully, future technologies will vastly mitigate the existing difficulties. 8. Sheldan, many of your updates refer to the need for us to spread the ‘Web of Light’ into the world. How do you expect this to happen? The World-wide Web of Light is a very important concept. It's a concept with which the Federation, as well as the Angelic Realms, are very, very involved. They feel that the web of consciousness, which is what this Web of Light is, will be spread in two basic ways. First, they look upon their work, which they are doing every day, to bring more consciousness into the planet and to help this Web of Light happen. Then, those concerned individuals who feel very deeply the need to accomplish this Web of Light, will have the individual energies to accomplish it. The second point refers to our own responsibilities. We have to take the information that has been given to us to create the various PAG groups around the planet, and to link the PAGs up with the most modern state-of-the-art technologies and trainings possible. This second part will happen because of the first. As people become more interested and awakened, and as those who see what already has happened come together and discuss it and do the things out of their passion and need, then all will happen. Remember that the key to all things is intent, and we have the intent to make it happen. And if these two things happen as they are supposed to - indeed, as they are now happening - then it will truly happen. We do not have to be worried or upset or in panic over timing. We just have to do the divine flow, what feels good inside us, and let it happen. That is all that is required. 9. Because we live in a world that measures time in 3-D scientific terms, many of us have difficulty with the concepts of time and Right Divine Time. Could you clarify Right Divine Time and explain why it is so different from our own measurement of time? Right divine time is basically what it sounds: time that is set up for the right flow to happen at the sacred moment when it is supposed to. When everything is in Right Divine timing or in Right Divine flow, it occurs. We have to understand that our concept of time is actually illusory. The concept of short, sequential bursts, which is how we measure and understand time, is actually not the way time is. Time flows, and as it flows it creates only a 'now'. This 'eternal now' moves forward and creates what in sequential time we call past, present and future. In actuality, there is only present, and when the present comes together and creates the need for what must happen, then what is divinely ordained occurs. That is the difference between right divine time and what we think of as time. When we understand that, and allow it to flow and become one with our inner beingness, then all the anxieties that we have about time cease. 10. Given the extensive research into finding extraterrestrial life in the universe being conducted by the SETI Institute, has the Galactic Federation contacted these scientists? What the Federa
ion has been doing is very simple. Those SETI groups, for instance the CSETI, etc., have been contacted in various forms and ways. Right now the process is very simple. What the Galactic Federation wish us to understand more than anything is that there is a consciousness energy coming. This consciousness energy affects what is to happen. They are beings of high consciousness. We are beings of lower consciousness who are moving towards their consciousness. They understand what must happen. To us, they - the elder brothers and sisters - are the ones who are attempting to utilize their abilities to bring forth a new reality. This reality is something that goes beyond anything that we know or understand, and all they wish is simply to do it, or - to use what was said in the last question - to do it in a right divine time and in a right divine way. So yes, some people have been contacted, others have not. It just depends on whether they're ready and where their consciousness is. 11. Since we are being told that our bodies are being changed, why are most of us feeling so incredibly tired these days? Could you explain more about the body? What is happening to us is a very simple process of the ascension. When you reach certain levels of the anchoring in of your light body, of the changing in your cellular structure at the genetic levels of your RNA and DNA - at these levels, your body is overtaxed. Look at yourself, once again, as a small child - in this case, a toddler, less than age 3 - attempting to grow. And what do children do? They sleep a lot. They feel fatigued. They have a great deal of energy, giant bursts of it at times, and then, seemingly, it goes away. This is all that is happening. No more, no less. So just go with it and realize that it’s part of the entire process of your growth in consciousness and of the bringing forth, the integration, of your physical and spiritual beings. 12. How will the full impact of the Photon Belt affect Earth's nuclear reactors? As I stated when I talked about the Photon Belt previously, when nuclear energy interacts with the Photon Belt, there is normally a vast explosion. Therefore, the key to what the Federation is going to do, before we interact directly with the Photon Belt and likely before, is to make sure that these nuclear energy systems, whether they are military reactors, civilian electrical reactors, etc., are de-activated and are no longer a part of the whole procedure. So don’t worry about that. Just know that it will be taken care of when the time comes. 13. I have been told by a couple of people that there will be an invasion of dark forces in April of this year. Would the Galactic Federation be aware of this situation and how would this affect the mass landings? Every so often there will be certain movings through of dark energies. These energies are part of the entire procedure of allowing this particular flow of light and dark around our world. However - and this is the key point - what is happening at this time, and from now on, is that this dark energy will not be allowed to cause massive difficulties on this world, as it has before. It will be allowed to do one thing: move through us, give us lessons, and then leave. Because right now, this is a planet of glowing light. It is a planet of change. It is a planet of transformation. At this moment, we are in a chrysalis and are transforming ourselves into the full conscious beings that we were meant to be. Therefore, this will not affect the landings, or any aspect of the ascension procedures that are now underway. 14. Should we be preparing welcoming committees to greet the non-sentient beings and the Galactic humans? Will we be given the necessary information on protocol, etiquette, and diplomatic courtesies? At the appropriate time, you will be told what has to be done as far as protocols, etc. Don't worry about that. Right now, what you simply have to do is to ‘be'. Do the things that are needed to bring forth consciousness. Do the things that are needed to remain positive. Do the things that are needed to keep connecting and networking with each other. When the time comes for the greetings, then you will be told what to do, what has to be said, how to put committees together, etc. Don't worry about that now. Just remain positive, move forward, put your Planetary Activation Groups together, network with other groups, network with the entire Planetary Activation Organization. Be one with yourself and with others, and move forward. That is what is important right now. "
Characterizing Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19. 	"Characterizing Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 APRIL 24, 2020 Rachel Lutz The original article, “ Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 ,” was published on ContagionLive.
As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to sweep through the US, older patients and those with > 1 underlying condition made up the highest number of hospitalizations, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
In an effort to categorize hospitalizations among patients, CDC investigators examined medical histories and epidemiological data from 1482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through March. The team used COVID-NET to identify their patients.
The study authors wrote that 75% of their patients were aged >50 years and about half were male. About 12% of the patients had data on their underlying conditions, and the most common conditions were hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
For patients aged 18-49 years, obesity was the most prevalent underlying condition, followed by chronic lung disease (mostly asthma, the study authors explained), and diabetes.
For older patients, obesity was also prevalent, followed by hypertension and diabetes. The oldest patients saw hypertension, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as their most common underlying condition.
“These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions,” the study authors wrote.
“These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (eg, social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain) to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public.”
Through March, the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate was 4.6 per 100,000 persons. However hospitalization rates increased by age: 0.3 in persons aged 0-4 years; 0.1 in patients aged between 5 and 17 years; 2.5 in those aged 18-49 years; 7.4 in those aged 50-64 years; and 13.8 in those older than 65 years.
Hospitalizations occurred more in men, the study authors found (5.1 vs 4.1 per 100,000, respectively). The investigators also had data on race and ethnicity for 580 patients and determined that 45% were white, 33% were black, 8% were Hispanic, and 5% were Asian. Less than 1% of the patients were American Indian/Alaskan Native, they added, while about 8% were of other or unknown race.
The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 days, the study authors found, after examining the available data from 167 patients. The most common symptoms at admission were cough (86% of patients), fever or chills (85% of patients), and shortness of breath (80% of patients). The investigators also noted gastrointestinal symptoms were common: about a quarter of patients had diarrhea and another quarter of patients presented with nausea or vomiting, they said.
“Early data from COVID-NET suggest that COVID-19–associated hospitalizations in the United States are highest among older adults, and nearly 90% of persons hospitalized have one or more underlying medical conditions,” the study authors concluded.
“Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.”"
Corona Virus WARNING. 	"Just something to be prepared for… but then it’s not a bad thing to consider during numerous arenas of viral issues. Print it and hand out to those who you care for – freinds, family and loved ones – and even those who you may not like. ~ Ed. This entry was posted in Point Blank on Into the Darkness... The phrase “ the Fall of America ” suggests some cataclysmic event ended the American Empire which had stretched from Maine to California and Florida to Washington. But at the end, there was no straining at the gates, no barbarian horde that dispatched the Empire in one fell swoop. Rather, the Empire fell slowly, as a result of challenges from within and without, and changing over the course of hundreds of years until its form was unrecognizable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCkHanF4v1w
~ Quotables ~ The only way socialism has any chance in America is for the education system to push it in schools. Remember, the father of their modern education ‘Elite’ beliefs is John Dewey. Dewey was a communist, failed teacher who pushed what are now clearly failed education theories. Here is the quote of the day. “ This militant crowd is comprised of uninformed and misinformed people looking at themselves as unfortunate, underpaid, underappreciated victims of capitalism, overwhelmed with jealousy that there are people who are everything they are not. ” You are going to have to take ownership over the education of your children ~"
